      "This is a camping ground that feels very public. There is nothing much dividing the camping space with the local houses and the guests dropping in for swimming at the beach. It therefore felt a little odd leaving the tent there for a day while we went sightseeing. At 円1200 per night for a couple, plus 円300 for the sun shelter and 円80 for rubbish disposal, it was okay value. Proximity to the closest conbini is about 2km. There is a little supermarket very close by but opens a bit later in the morning so not great for breakfast items.\nPretty basic but very clean with excellent beach access, dog friendly and excellent views of beautiful coastline.",

The grass and the pine trees are perfectly cut, and you can park the bike just by the side of the tent which allowed me to take a beautiful picture which is now a treasured memory of the trip. In addition the staff were super friendly. Will never forget it!",

      "2017年6月視察\nテント泊で利用しようとこちらに行きました、狭い山道を走ります、最初こんな都心部にほんとにあんのかよwって思いましたが山がありました。山頂近くなると高岡を展望でき景色はとても良いです。キャンプ場につくと何組かいらっしゃいました。管理棟は閉鎖されておりましたので役所に電話したら使ってくださいとのことでした。そして野営地を選んでいると、やたら虫が多い。そしてきわめつけは熊に注意、ヘタレな私はそっ閉じして園山キャンプ場に移動しました。熊井に注意って万一でたら無理ゲーですからね。何人かで利用するなら良いと思いました。",
      "2017.５/27(土)28(日)にバイクツーリングキャンプで利用しました。\n小高い山の木々に囲まれた静かなキャンプ場でした。オートサイトにはそれぞれ煉瓦で炉が組んでありました。各サイトはそれほど広くありませんが、ソロキャンプでは充分でした。炊事場やトイレはよく整備されており、とても無料とは思えませんでした。一応水道水ですが、飲用には煮沸を勧められました。\nゴミは全て持ち帰りです。\nとてもいいところですので大切に利用したいものです。",
      "無料の公営キャンプ場。管理棟横に飲料自動販売機1台あり。オートキャンプサイトは10区画。それぞれに煉瓦積みの炉が備え付けられている。林の中のテントサイトは13区画。それぞれ6坪前後。月曜日は管理者不在。アクセスは二上山万葉ラインから脇道へ入り、すれ違いの出来ない舗装路（退避所は3箇所程あり）を400m下る（2017年5月）",
      "無料というのがびっくり！\nバイクの人は夜来て寝て早朝に速攻に出て行く感じ。\n予約必要ですが、空いて入れば使える。\nただ、受付のおばちゃんがいっていましたが、ゴミを置いて行く人、散らかして帰る人いるようで、綺麗に使いましょう^_^",
      "無料にみえない無料キャンプ場\n市が管理しているキャンプ場です。\n利用には現地にて受付に名前を書くか、\n交流館に電話をして行くことを伝える必要があります。\n平日は管理人不在もあって知ってか知らずか申込書等を書かずに利用されている方もちらほら。\n土日は電話予約必須です。利用者が多いらしいので予約しておかないと現地に行って受付の時には空いていないことがあるそうです。\nオートサイトは焚き火が可能です。焚き火ができる釜もあります。\nテントサイトは火器厳禁になってます。\n\n今回はオートサイトを利用しましたが綺麗に整備されていて芝生が気持ちいいです。\n野うさぎも生息しているみたいでかなり近づいても逃げませんでした。\nカラスも多いですが、悪さはしません。\nただ餌などをやると人の食べ物を捕食するようになるので食べ物を与えないでとのこと。\n芝生は結構アリが多いです。これちょっと注意した方がいいかも？\n朝起きたら食べ物に使った食器類に大量はアリが湧いていてびっくりしました。\n夜は焚き火に木の隙間から高岡の夜景、星も綺麗です。\n洗い場もあり自販機もあるので飲み物は切らしても大丈夫でしょう"

      "湖全体としては、過去に事故などいろいろあったようですが、それはどこも一つや二つはあっても仕方ないというか、あり得ることなので評価に含めずとも良いかと。\nロケーションは素晴らしいです。ハイシーズンを避けて訪れれば、木漏れ日が眠気を誘うようなゆったりとした時間の流れの中に身を置けます。ハイシーズンにはヘイケボタルの観賞も出来ます。\n設備も平均的に充実してると言えるのではないでしょうか。特に同じキャンプ場で提供しているボート関係のサービスは、カヤック、カヌー、手漕ぎ、SUP、スワンなどなど豊富でした。ただし料金は高いですが、、、。\n以上、場所と設備に関してはとても良い印象を受けましたが、悲しいかな管理人さんについては過去の口コミを頭から否定できない印象を抱いてしまいました。キャンプ場利用については、夜な夜な馬鹿騒ぎしたりごみの管理がザルな一部の非常識キャンパーを除いて、皆さん最低限の分別を持ち合わせている上で利用するのだと思います。なのにここの管理人さんはキャンパーへの要求が細かすぎますし、なによりその説明が機械的です。事前に必ず確認すべきこととしてホームページにでもなんでも良いから掲げておけば済む話なのに、受付時にやたらと細かいことをまくし立てられては、お客はわけがわからなくなってしまうでしょう。実際そうでしたし、なんでもっと要領よく出来ないのか、ローカルルールがあるなら、最低限守ってほしいものだけ列挙すればいいだろうに、まるで留守番電話サービスの音声の如く一方的に並べ立てるというのは聞いている方の気持ちを考えているとは思えませんでした。わからないことを尋ねたくて説明を遮れば、上から目線で叱り付けられる始末です。直近で訪ねたのがハイシーズンで忙しかったかなのでしょうか？誰も悪さをしにこのキャンプ場に来ているわけではないのですけどね、、、^^;　　何とも不思議な管理人さんでした。唯一残念なポイントですが、管理人さんのワンマンで回っているのかもしれないですし、過去の口コミから随分と時間も経っている上でのアレですから、いまさら改善を望むのは厳しいのかもしれません。幸い、青木湖には他にもキャンプ場はありますし、そちらの評価は悪くないようですから、キャンプは別にして、後述の観賞ツアーなどはこちらのキャンプ場のを使うのもアリなのかも知れませんね。\n青木湖でのおススメは、同じキャンプ場や別のスクールなどでも行っているホタル観賞のナイトクルージングですね。若干料金は高めです。大型のカヌーに10人程度で乗船し、ガイドさんが一人ついてくれて周遊するのですが、中には星にとても詳しいガイドさんもいらっしゃるのでとても楽しめます。そのガイドさんは陶芸もやっていらっしゃるようで、気さくでとても良いガイドさんでした。\nというわけで、でこぼこな評価を総合するとこんな感じの星数になります。",
      "青木湖へは、足掛け35年くらいキャンプへ出掛けています。\nこちらにお世話になったことはありませんが。\n自分が幼少のころ、こちらのキャンプ場では売店で民芸品も売っていて、\n木製のミニチュア古民家を買った覚えがあります。\n釣りエサや釣り針なども。\n\n代替わりして、施設利用者以外には\n何も販売しない方針になったようです。\n\n朝から録音の場内放送が鳴り響き、\nゴミはどうしろだの、それはああしろだの、\n湖畔の静寂は台無しです。\n\n数年前に大学生らしき団体の宿泊者が、\n夜中（24時）までラップ音楽を\nスピーカーからかけならし、\n飲酒の声もウルサイので\n注意しに行きました。\n幸い聞き入れてくれましたが。\n\n消灯時間の指導もお願いしたいです。",

      "「ルールが厳しい」等の噂は、家族連れや普通の常識人にとってはごく当たり前のマナーなので大丈夫ですよ。(この噂のお陰でタチの悪い客が減った)\n不審者などが場内に無断で立ち入らないように監視しているようなので安心です。"

      "À very Nice place to camp but à little bit expensive, 1300 yens/p and no shower. You need to go at the onsen ans pays 450 yens more.",
      "2泊3日のファミリーキャンプで利用しました。\n\nロケーションは本当に素晴らしく、天候さえ良ければ最高の休暇を過ごせると思います。\n\n夕方（15時？）頃から常に6-7mくらいの風が吹き下りてくるので、湖畔っぺりにテントやタープを出す場合は開口部を考慮したほうが良いです。20時前には風はだいたい収まったと記憶しています。\n風のお陰で洗濯物の乾きは早いですが、焚火などの火の粉の行方について注意が必要ですので、ご参考まで。\n\nサイト自体はフリーサイトで空いてさえいればどこにでもテントを張れますが、水捌けのいい場所はそんなに多くないので場所選びは慎重に。比較的ペグの刺さりは良いですが、松の根が結構張り巡っているのでペグダウンの際にはご注意を。（抜くことの出来ない鍛造ペグが何本か刺さったまま放置されていました）\n\n湖は遠浅で水質も良く、子供でも安心して遊ばせることができます。\nちょろちょろと泳いでいる小魚がパッと見て分かるくらいの透明度ですので、網などを持っていっても楽しいかもしれません。\n透き通った水と青い空の組み合わせは本当に最高で、大人でも飛びこむのを我慢できないくらいです。\nうっかりしているとクワガタがテント内に居たりする（実体験）くらい自然が豊かなので、必要な方は虫取り網もお忘れなく。\n\n管理棟付近には何頭かの猫がいます。\nステッカーやグッズを買って彼らのご飯代に貢献しましょう。（任意）\n\nトイレに関しては泡洗浄というちょっと変わった方式のものとなっていて、水洗ではないですが匂い等もなくとても清潔です。\n個室内に貼ってある「玉無し伝説」も必読。\n\n湖畔のサイトではありますが、洗い場には下水が整備されているらしく食器用洗剤の使用が可能です。\n直火は禁止で、22時以降は静かに過ごしましょう、とのことです。\nゴミの回収については、車での来場者は基本持ち帰りで、バイク等の「どうしても持って帰れないと見てわかる」場合のみ、要相談とのことでした。\n\nコンビニ（ローソン）と温泉（ゆ～ぷる木崎湖）がすぐ近くにあります。\n食材の買い出しはSEIYU大町店がお勧めです。\n\nGoogle translation:\n\nWe used it at family camp of 2 nights 3 days.\n\nThe location is really wonderful, I think we can have the best vacation if weather permitting.\n\nSince winds of about 6 - 7 m always blow down from around evening (around 15 o?), It is better to consider the opening in order to bring out a tent or a tarp on the lake side. I remember that the wind had fallen almost at 20 o'clock.\nDrying of the laundry is fast because of the wind, but please be careful about the way of sparks such as fire and fire, for your information.\n\nThe site itself can be tented anywhere as long as it is free at the free site, but carefully choose the place because there are not many places with good watering. Relatively peg stuffing is good, but the roots of the pine are pretty stretched around so be careful when peg down. (There were several forged pegs that could not be pulled and left standing)\n\nThe lake is shallow and has good water quality, so even children can play with confidence.\nIt is enough transparency to see the small fish swimming in a minute, so it may be fun to take a net etc.\nThe combination of crystal clear water and blue sky is really the best, and even adults can not stand to jump in.\nIf you are careless, stag beetle in the tent (real experience), so nature is rich, so do not forget the insect net if you need one.\n\nThere are some cats near the management building.\nLet's buy stickers and goods and contribute to their vintage. (Any)\n\nRegarding the toilet, it is a kind of strange type called foam washing, it is not rinsing but it is very clean without smells.\nWe also must read \"Tamashi no Legend\" pasted in a private room.\n\nAlthough it is on the lakeside site, it seems that sewage is being maintained in the washroom and it is possible to use dishwashing detergent.\nDirect flame is prohibited, after 22 o'clock, let's quietly.\nRegarding the collection of garbage, visitors by car were the basic take-out, and it was necessary consultation only when you can see by looking at motorcycle etc \"I can not bring home by all means.\"\n\nConvenience stores (Lawson) and hot springs (Yu - Puru Kizaki Lake) are nearby.\nSEIYU Omachi shop is recommended for the purchase of ingredients.",
      "場所も環境いいところだが、アニメの聖地らしくその手の需要を取り込んで運営されている様子。\nもちろんそっち系の趣味の方々には良いところなのだろうが、\n何も知らずに家族連れで行ってしまったら・・・\n管理棟前の自動販売機からいきなりその手のおっぱいねぇちゃんイラストに出迎えられ、\n売店もキャンプ用品や食材よりもアニメグッズに埋もれています。\nそういった趣味をどうこう言うつもりはないですが、\nもう少し一般？客に対して事前にインフォメーションしてもいいのでは？",
      "湖畔にあり夏には湖水浴が楽しめる。他にはバス釣り、カヌー、パラグライダーと１回では遊び尽くせない。キャンプ場設備はバンガロー（電気使用可）、炊事場、トイレがあり、歩いて10分ほどの距離には木崎湖温泉ゆ～ぷるがある。",
      "木崎湖畔で温泉(ゆーぷる木崎湖温泉)、コンビニが近くて便利です。値段もぼちぼちなので、満足出来るキャンプが出来るのでは❗"

      "Nicest RV Park in Fairbanks.  Stayed 6 weeks, close to town and convenient to Fred Meyer shopping.  RV Park is part of the larger complex of cottages and restaurant.  The Restaurant/Bar on site is Chena Alaska Grill.  Food is a little pricey but really good.  They have a nice deck for dining as well.  Easy walk to Pikes Landing Restaurant for less expensive food.  Pikes also has a deck on the River.  The Princess Lodge is 1/2 way between the RV Park and Pikes, they have a restaurant and bar as well.  WIFI was excellent.  Cable was horrible, couldn't watch it at our site because it was so fuzzy.  Owners need to clear out or cut up and back the trees on the sites as well as get rid of the sticker bushes that are along some sites.  Seems like the owners also need to capitalize on the riverbank and build it up so guest have a comfortable place to sit and watch the river go buy.   We paid $52 a night in July and August.  Manager is very friendly and helpful.  Would stay again.",
      "Nice RV Park.  Haven't used their WiFi or cable, so can't comment on that.  Good water pressure, decent showers.  Plenty of washer and dryer, 3.00$ per load for each.  Sites are good sized.  ",
      "Convenient location. Grounds are well kept. Sites are close together but not quite on top each other. Staff friendly and helpful. Would return to this RV park again.",
      "Nice people and the hotel is close to downtown. I am not sure if a hotel/RV Park can get a 5 but....",
      "Rivers Edge clean.  The staff seemed a little on edge.  Bathrooms were clean but not nice. \nI give two stars because this is not a $60 a day place. Touching branches on drivers side  there wasn't enough room to open the awning. \n"

      "It's a fine campground. The 1-star review by Christopher Lipphardt was meant for Lone Fir Resort in Cougar, WA. Unfortunately it's been cross-posted here  by mistake. (I've flagged it as \"off-topic\" - closest I could get.)",
      "Great USFS campground just off Hwy 20, about 35 miles west of Winthrop, and right outside North Cascades Nat'l Park. Good place to camp if you want to do some hiking and exploring in the Ross and Diablo Lakes areas.",
      "Got to Lone Fir ahead of my group to grab a first come, first serve site. After fully paying for the site for 4 days x $17 = $68, putting the tag up and go out to see WA pass for the afternoon, I came back to someone backing in an RV because the Ranger had come by and pulled the ticket. I followed all the rules, fully paid, but pulled site tab anyway. I haven't gotten any response from the Ranger station, left multiple voicemails, but no one seems to care. \nAnd there is no running water, no camp host and the bathroom ran out of TP. This is the worst experience I've ever had at a NF campground and I routinely camp & climb year round. And all of this over 4th July weekend, the busiest of all.",
      "28 yr Active Duty military, family camper, and world traveler here...Please Do NOT spend your money here.  It's not possible to fully explain my disappointment with the facilities and the owner.  I reviewed other customer reviews before submitting this, and I see a trend with ownership (Jeremy's) attitude towards his customers.  \n    I've never been to a campground that felt so much like a prison camp.  If you have a family with kids or dogs then be prepared for the owner, Jeremy, to loiter around your site and issue you a stern threat of \"kicking you out without a refund\" if there is any noise made after 10pm.  He is intolerant of any noise he can hear.  We found him standing in the dark near our site multiple times trying to eavesdrop...pretty creepy.\n    The RV sites are packed together with fire pits in the strangest locations.  This results in your campfire being behind your back bumper and often 5-10 ft away from your neighbors fire or camper.  There is only one restroom for the entire park, there aren't enough toilets/showers...and it was disgusting every time.   The campground is right next to the highway and you will be forced to hear/watch logging trucks and 4x4s blast by at high speed all night.  The \"free\" wireless is worthless and if you're there when it rains...expect 1-4 inch deep standing water throughout your site.  \n     We had 5 RV's leave the campground early and we refuse to return.  The night before we left I tried giving Jeremy honest helpful feedback...my tone was friendly and calm, but Jeremy became irate and began yelling.  He refused to listen and responded like a petulant child instead of a grown adult.  After he knew we were leaving he then said we were kicked out for being noisy, but admitted that nobody had complained of noise once.  He even went as far as insulting my military service.  Truly disappointed."

      "We were excited to stay here for two nights in August but had to cancel due to unforeseen circumstances. I looked at the cancellation policy and saw that we would be paying a $25 cancellation fee but would get the rest back as we gave over a week's notice to cancel. I contacted the resort and received $6.50 back for one night minus the cancellation fee. I am still waiting for the full refund for the second night and the resort will not return any of my communications. I was excited about the place and was going to try again next year when we could reschedule our trip, but this will not be happening now. I had read the fine print and know about the cancellation fee, but the lack of communication about the refund for the second night is unacceptable. It's been over three weeks now. It's only $35, you'd think they'd just process the refund as we gave sufficient notice...",
      "Nice spot along the lake. Campsites had very little privacy. Lots of junk laying around which gave it a poor vibe. Aside from the new playground the park felt run down and rough. It's unfortunate as the area has potential. 50 plus for a night this was our most expensive stay and the worst park we have visited on our journey. Nice staff park needs to be upkept.",
      "Small campsite with limited (but clean!) facilities. Next to Williamson Lake, which is also open to people who are not staying on the campsite.\n\nWiFi range is limited to around 30 feet around the office, so you're out of luck if you get a spot towards the end of the site.\n\nDo bring your mosquito repellent, quiet waters will attract a lot of these pests during the warm season!",

      "I thoroughly enjoyed my 3 days at Blue Cedars RV Park & Campground. The thing that most impressed me was the women’s washroom! Clean. Clean. A long bank of sinks, one even lower than the rest to accommodation our youngsters. An adequate number of plug-ins, a bright environment, and hot showers were all part of the “plus”. Bonus; showers are included in the campsite fee. The outdoor pool was another bonus. I felt there was ample room at the individual campsites for folks like me not requiring hooks-up. The non-full services sites are adequate in size, close to a water tap, and have a table. The owner has placed a porta-pottie at a convenient location, away from the full-amenities washroom, allowing guests a shorter walk. I felt welcomed at this Park. There are trees, there is grass. When thanking the owner for a great time and commending him on a lovely campsite I was quite surprised when he mentioned some had complained. For what, I wondered? Because some have complained, I wanted to speak of my positive experience.",
      "This seemed like a place operating for maximum profit with the bare amenities and maintenance needed to get by.  I had to walk a long way to the dumpster to throw something away.  Garbage cans would be very helpful.  It sounded like we were camping next to a freeway, which meant not much sleep since we were tent camping.  Bad experience.",
      "I have no idea where all these folks who wrote good reviews stayed, but it wasn't here! Old guy in office is just plain rude.  Locks and unlocks office door when he doesn't want to be bothered. Place is filthy with debris, garbage in fire rings, dog poop, and our site had old patio mat that looks like it's been there for years. Wouldn't even let the dog walk on it. Pool is closed, looks like it hasn't been used in years and area is full of old tires and garbage.  Bathrooms looks like they may have been redone at some point, but they are moldy and smell now.  Wifi is a joke. Old guy probably turns that off and on as well.  Too many other campgrounds in area to stay here. ",
      "Hidden gem. Beautiful stalls, quiet. Showers on site. They even have quaint little cabins you can rent.",
      "We stayed as evacuees from Williams Lake for over a month. We have zero complaints. I'm shocked that so many people have so many complaints but I suppose most people will jump on the internet to complain at their easiest opportunity. Morley (the manager) and Christine were fantastic to our family and many others during the evacuation. They went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and looked after. There was a broken board at the play ground, we mentioned it to them and it was fixed immediately. Yes there is some noise from the highway however you are staying close to town, that is part of camping close to town with Costco and other stores 5 minutes away!......this campground takes pets, they have no restrictions, the showers are not coin operated, therefore FREE. There is WiFI, it's great when the entire campground isn't full and using it but you can't fault the campground for what you think is poor internet as that will happen anywhere you have a large number of people using at once.  I witnessed the campground manager having to clean up garbage from sites where people were just irresponsible about leaving garbage out or leaving garbage behind when they check out. I witnessed him dealing with people on a few occasions over the course of our time there, I never once thought he was unpleasant. He is just to the point and honest, which I appreciate and some people just can't handle! My family will stay here again and this will be our preferred place to camp when we visit PG."

We didn't talk to a single employee. Booked on line . There was a clip board out side the office with our site number on it, and no need to check in when leaving. The privacy between sites is zero, but they are kinda staggered so you get a little off set. We did not use the shower house's or washrooms .",
      "After reading the reviews, I feel lucky that I had a fantastic experience at Whistler RV. I went tent camping with my husband, my 5 year-old girl and an 8 month-old boy. We also noted that we had a large tent when booking in addition to having child and infant. The campground placed us with a large pad, beautiful tall trees at the background, and pretty close to the bathroom.  Can't ask for a better site for our family.  Customer service, they responded to my email query about fire ban and propane fire pit within couple hours and were courteous.",
      "Never stayed and never will even think about it again. I cancelled 8 days prior to arrival due to forest fires and the road in from our arrival destination was closed. They refused to refund me my money. I would have been better off cancelling the day prior. I would have gotten some sort of refund then. I was trying to be courteous so they could book out our site sooner...They are crooks as far as I'm concerned. I'm sure we were not the only people that cancelled and they were trying to save their profits for the season because of all the fires.",
      "The brochure and website for this park says 'free shuttle to village' and 'free wifi'. When we arrived we were told that the shuttle had not operated for 2 years, and that there was an $11 a day charge for wifi. When we told the girl on the front desk, she said that 'one of our companies hasn't updated it yet'. It's been 2 years... Also, all of the brochures in the Whistler Village Tourist information center (which had clearly been refilled recently) also made those claims. It was simply false advertising. Also, this park is no where near Whistler village. It was a good 10-15 minute drive which meant you also needed to pay the $30 a day RV parking charge at Whistler.",
      "While it is kind of like sardines in a can without much division between sites, the site was level with an amazing view.\nPeople were extremely quiet. No disruption of other people.\nWiFi is an extra fee. It is very hard to get in touch with an employee, by phone, or at the desk."

Get up for the sunrise and walk over to the east side to see it if you don't get a site nearby. Good prices for water and power and they even give you free firewood!!",

      "We stayed the last week of September 2017. I've never stayed in a more beautiful camp, especially for the money. It is well manicured while still felling natural. If the Smurfs ever manage a campground, this is it, magical!  Radium hot springs pool & spa is only ten minutes away.  It's great for recharging & relaxing after a long day trip as it's open some seasons until 11 pm!\n\nCanyon RV Resort is the perfect launching point for day trips to the more expensive to stay at Banff & Chateau Lake Louise areas. Plus you get the gorgeous 90 plus minute drive. The exact drive time will vary depending on how much your crew stops to explore!  There are a dozen places to stop along the way to look out or hike along the emerald green Bow river on the way north to Lake Louise.",
      "Treated badly by owner, because we had reserved and then asked if they would have a site available by the creek when we arrived, even though we hadn't requested it in our reservation request. We were put in site#3 which was barely long enough for our fifth wheel and although we had stated in our request that we had slides the site wasn't wide enough. Because the owner felt that my husband \"embarrassed her ' in the office by asking, she stomps down to the inferior site to continue the argument. When I asked her where we should park the truck she said on the grass, even tho right on the rules it says not even to put a mat on the grass and park on the patio so our slide would fit. We were ready to  unhook and she evicted us! We had accepted the site but she needed to be right and win! She said she had told us on our confirmation that it twas site three, well it's hard to tell what the site is truly like until you get there! Make sure you ask for EVERYTHING you want when you reserve so you don't upset the owner!  UNBELIEVABLE !!! hissy fit! Seen her upset before with  another patron and was crying and complaining to me outside my truck window because he yelled at her, which was unprofessional, to involve me because her feelings were hurt.",
      "Let's get this out of the way first... Yes, the toilets and showers are clean. In fact they sparkle. Day or night they were always clean and fresh.\n\nWe visited the Canyon RV Resort near the end of July 2017 at the end of our trip across western Canada.\n\nThe resort is a beautiful place to have a relaxing break.  The tin lids will love it. A beautiful shallow stream runs through the middle of park creating a dream playground for the adventurous ones.  For those less adventurous it is a wounderful setting for an evening stroll, crossing back and forth over the babbling brook as you work your way from one end of the park to the other.\n\nThe sites are generously sized. Many back right on to the stream creating a very relaxed and pleasant atmosphere.  We stayed in \"Site #0\" - a perfect sized spot for our little RV.  Having stayed at the park, a site next to the stream will be our choice next time.\n\nThe park is lovingly maintained and is always clean. Not once did we spot a single piece of litter. There were lots of dogs in the park, however they are always on a lead and I don't recall hearing a single bark.\n\nCheck out the photos - they don't lie.  This is a beautiful resort with great managers and an obviously devoted and caring team.\n\nBrian J & Sherry T\nSydney, Australia",
      "Delightful site, good showers, laundry, very helpful staff. Trees and pretty planting, hard roads, no dust.\nBrook running through site disguises any noise there may be from road.\nWish we could clone it and install other places.\nBest site on our Canada trip so far.\nPity it was raining!!!",
      "Awesome park! Well kept, beautiful area. Friendly staff. Stayed 5 days and will be back. One of our favourite campsites."

It's the worst we've ever experienced in a campsite!\n The power outlet is at the front of the stall?.....you will need an extra cord to reach it, at least it was that way for our stall. The person working though, was great and got us a cord to reach the outlet. We tried to book elsewhere while we were there but of course, every place was booked on late notice. Don't stay in the North stalls, the road ways in front of the stalls are gravel, very dusty, no one slows down. The other road ways are paved!",

They said because people would leave the water running. I thought well then just put on shut off valves. Don't charge people. But then they explained that everyone is starting to charge for water and I thought in 5,000 miles, this was the first place to charge for showers. It just comes across as really cheap and I, personally, don't like cheap people. Other than that it was a nice place.",

The fourth shower leaked so much the buildup of iron on the floor was totally unappealing.  And, you had to pay $5 for each shower!  Insects in the sink made brushing your teeth or washing your face a major challenge. The campground itself was mostly barren and open with no shade but lots of dust. Trash was all over!  There were a few okay tent camp sites but most were either too small or in the open. I had a paper that said the cost was $20 a night but they charged us $25, and there was no store or food available. Do not go here.",
      "As many people stated this is a beautiful campground. The woman checking us in was very friendly even though it was evening when we arrived. The RV and tent campground is down the paved road near the lake. The check-in office, nearby road and teepees are not visible from the campground. We had 50amp electric, water and sewer for $50 a night (no tax as this is on the Reservation). The ground, although a field and the very rainy weather when we were there) was very solid for our 35' RV and spacious. We had a view of the beautiful mountains. We had great Verizon service and no T-Mobile service. We enjoyed our stay!",

      "The staff was great and there's a lot of campsites to pick from. It does get really windy out here, and not much shade. If you don't take a shower by 5 p.m. expect freezing cold water. They say that the showers can have hot water enough for six different showers but it seems to be off by the time then the sun sets. The bathroom only has three showers. The center shower tends to be a shower for kids. The shower head is very low and there a very fim light to help.\nWhere we camped we ended up having a private beach. We had three fire pits to pick from and plenty of parking in the center. The staff was very helpful and accommodating for all of our questions. The washer and dryer were out of service at the time. One of the cheaper sites though! Very close to the park entrance and ten minutes down the road from general store and gas. (Sinclair,  also one of the cheaper had stations- credit card only!))\nI had verizon service.  Nothing for tmobil or sprint."

      "We had a very bad bear experience tent camping here.  After spending several days wilderness camping to peace and quiet in Glacier we got a campsite here for the last night of the season (we were the only tent campers).  They didn't warn us about bear precautions at all, but we ran into a local RV camper who said there had been a grizzly around on a fairly regular basis.  Though we kept all food separate from our tent area, we were woken up at midnight to 2 very agitated grizzly bears in our campground who had most likely been accustomed to feeding off of scraps in the area, and had to leave and spend the night in our car.  On top of all of this, the tent-sites were mostly littered with cow patties.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily dissuade someone with an RV from staying here (it looks like that makes up most of their customers anyways) but they should get rid of the tent-sites if they are not willing to maintain them and take the necessary bear precautions.",
      "This is a lovely, small Campground in the Glacier National Park. They have wonderful hiking trails, outstanding drives, and a pretty good restaurant as well. We were permitted to park our trailer near where the tent campers area was, and leave it while we went for a drive for the day. They even watched the trailer for us and did not charge us. In the morning I hiked my dog not too far away to where the horseback riding was available. I did not enter the horseback riding area. A large, territorial dog rushed out of the horse area toward my dog but was called back by a woman who came out of her trailer. It appeared she was the person in charge of the horseback riding. I said good morning and she did not respond to me, rather just glared at me. Well I'm sure the pup was just doing its job, I would never ride a horse there, due to her discourtesy. I prefer to spend my money where I am made to feel welcome. Yes, my dog was on a leash. No, her dog was not on a leash. We did meet two very friendly Park employees who had a trailer parked next to ours. They were so happy to recommend great drives and things to do in the park for us. They had an awesome dog named Marley who was an absolute angel. I would definitely revisit Glacier National Park and I would definitely stay in the park again. ",
      "We stayed in the dry camping area in our 25' motor home because there were no sites with hookups available.  I'm so glad there weren't!  The dry camping part of this campground felt like a state park.  There were trees and grass.  The sites were spacious with fire rings and picnic tables.  There were ample faucets to obtain water very close to our site. It wasn't noisy or crowded.  We loved it here and wished we had been able to  stay longer.",
      "The place is pretty dated in every respect. It's  in an area with  little to do other than drive through the GNP or hike. They had musical slots going on and we lost a whole day waiting for our new slot to become available. Very inconvenient  and a lot of trouble.We wanted to leave a day early and asked  for  refund on one night 48 hours in advance. But they absolutely do not let go o f your money under any circumstances. Would stay on the West side of Glacier  Park if had it to do over again. The only thing good here is a nice view.",

Absolutely beautiful campground right by the water and it has a nice interpretive trail, plus easy access to the rocky, clammy beach which we walked on for a ways (lots of clams and oysters here all over the beach!)!  It's a fairly small campground with lots of privacy between the sites, and very much in the forest.  Also the sites were very roomy and comfy!",
      "The best campground we have ever stayed at!!!! Very private, secluded camping spots and a very friendly camp host!!!!",
      "Lovely little campground right on the Hood Canal. Bathrooms, running potable water.",
      "A beautiful place to visit for a great quick day trip!",
      "It is a small camp ground with no electricity right on beach.  Short wood trail along the beach line.   Road to both side are residential area with road block/netted.   No electricity with clean flush toilet.     Tmobile 4gLTE is super strong in this area."

      "Наш любимый пляж Звезда, весной сюда завозят чистый песок, красивый берег с камнями, есть беседки для отдыха и шашлыка. Заезд на парковку платный 200-300 руб. Но можно авто оставить рядом со шлакбаумом и дойти 5-10 минут бесплатно )) Летом на пляже народу очень много.",
      "Очень хорошее место. Чистый пляж, площадка для детей, место где можно напрокат взять всякие штуки для плавания, киоски, где можно купить перекусить, кабинки для переодевания, кранчики с водой, где можно помыть ноги. ",
      "Самый нормальный пляж в городе. А еще здесь есть Ветру-Да.",

Crusty old hermit as \"camp host\" seems only interested in socializing with other squatters in the campground, in my opinion. When asked questions, is gruff and unfriendly. He used only hose-connectable water source in campground to turn road in front of his campsite into quagmire to keep his dust down. Perhaps he was just having a bad dust week? No views from campsites. Lots of yellowjackets. No activities or amenities.One mile to town. No real restaurants or cafes in town. Tavern is open to those over 21. Gasoline available sometimes at exorbitant rates. Coffee shop open part time. Groceries not available but some dry goods at highly inflated prices. Lake and creek overgrown with seaweed and algae. Location is very remote. Nearest amenities are at Moscow - one hour drive. Some facilities at Deary - 30 minute drive. Definitely not worth $20 a night for electricity and a stall.",

      "I went tent camping here with the family; Things were left a little to be desired due to lack of shade + noisy nearby road, but overall things went fine for us. This seems to be a great spot for RVs and groups with ATVs who want an inexpensive long stay.\n\nPros: Free. Flat ground. Easily car & RV accessible. Nearby ATV trail (We didn't visit but others said it was great). A couple of large open sites for big RV groups. Three(?) decently shaded places for tent camping. Town with small convenience stores about 2 miles away. Fishing at the reservoir about 3 miles away (we caught trout, saw turtles, saw boat/canoe rental shop). Elk River Falls hiking trail about 7 miles away (2-4 mile hike depending on what you see)\n\nCons: Not a ton of shade overall. Nearby road is loud, traffic even during sleeping hours. No picnic tables. 10 sites but mixed bag of what was developed – couldn’t tell what was a site in some cases (downed branches, overgrown grass, etc.)\n\nOther Notes: Fire pit is a circle of stones/no grill. Saw a couple of small standing grills for coals at various locations. Not much to explore immediately off camp, need to travel a little but easy to get anywhere."

      "Nice campground with well cared for sites and nice flat areas for tents.  No toilet paper in the bathroom this day so come prepared for that.  Most of the surrounding area is fenced so not a lot of hiking options within the campground and finally, it's a small camp.  Friday night there were no sites available so luckily I found a friendly chap that was willing to share his site.",

      "This is a decent place to stay, in spite of the road noise.  The sites are a little close for larger Class A RV's.  Interior roads are level and the parking slots are level or nearly so.  Bathrooms and showers are clean and well maintained.  Quiet time was well observed.  The staff at check in were friendly.  One thing -- there are flying bugs EVERYWHERE.  They got in and on everything.  We even took a few dozen with us stuck in our awnings and hanging onto our RV when we left.  All-in-all, a fair place to stay for a fair price.",
      "Me and my wife have stayed in  many KOAs in our travels.. Yes it sits right next to a busy  road.. But the sites are very nice, the bathrooms are kept very clean,  the grounds are also kept very clean.. The playground my be not the best but again this is camping, bring your own toys.... Enjoy the chirping birds... But most of all the people who run this place are awesome, and approachable.. Thank you.. ",
      "Although this KOA isn't bad, I'd have a hard time recommending it for a tent site or cabin. The live music playing across the street kept my daughter up and subsequently my wife and I up as well. This wouldn't be a problem if I didn't intend to be up and about at a decent hour. And if you're staying in the cabin, you have to because it becomes a sweat box until after 10 PM. I was also a little on edge being so close to a heavily trafficked road and keeping an eye on all the passersby that came into the site for a short while. Although the bathrooms are well kept and the site isn't bad, I just can't help recommending against this KOA.",
      "Surrounding neighborhood made me a little nervous but actual campground is nice for an overnight stay and we felt very safe. They have gas and propane on site which is very convenient and reasonably priced. Laundry facility is also the nicest of any campground I have ever visited with plenty of washers and dryers so you won't have to wait. People were friendly as well. Connects to a nice bike trail that we used for running.",
      "Everything is code locked, no fire pit in many campsites, very cramped/no privacy, situated right beside a major highway, bugs were terrible, street light that was on all night directly above campsite. Easily the worst campsite I've ever been in at $50 a night."

We stayed in A loop site 5 and thought it was by far the best spot. A little exposed because it is on the outside. Don't leave anything on the tables: ravens will get it (we left tissues and a whole watermelon that both got destroyed).",

      "Worse experience ever in all our years of RVing. We asked for another site if and when avalable, when asked why, we expressed our concern for our safety ,due to site near highway and no security.  We were told that if we didn't feel safe  we had to leave inmediatly. No place to go  we were able to stay that night. (We were reserved  for one week) They were very rude with poor business skills.

      "Lovely park, lots of trees...well maintained.  Pool, bath houses, laundry.  Haven't been but have a little cafe up front attached to the check in and  small gift shop.  Very well done !",
      "Great location with good access to I-75. Just far enough away to hardly ever hear the road noise. There are many trees. Unfortunately, the summer brings dropping fruit that then make a mess & smells awful. Expect a lot of rain during the summer as this is a tropical area. The office staff is quite pleasant. The maintenance staff does their best but they need at least 2 more workers year round to keep the grounds really clean. The cleaning of the showers & laundry is done by 1 lady who works tirelessly to keep them really clean. We like the option to pay for using the laundry rather than being coin operated. The pool is a popular gathering spot. The fall & winter \"season\" brings many northern snow birds who flock to the white sugar sand beaches nearby. Winter is beautiful here! During that time there are lots of fun activities. The cafe is open during the winter months. Coconut Point & Gulf Coast Town Center malls are close as is Miramar Outlets. There are many nice shops & restaurants in Bonita Springs & Naples. ",
      "We have RVed winters around Florida now for 10 years ... mostly south of Miami Beach.  Decided to explore the west coast this winter and discovered Sanctuary where we stayed for the month of January before moving on.  We liked this park so much we just booked 3 months next winter.  The park is only 3 years old and the management is private, not one of the large conglomerates that take money out of their parks and don't put much back in.  We also like that it is owned and managed by Christians (hence Sanctuary!).  We like that it is a smaller 185 site park where you get to know others and hence its like a family.  The onsite restaurant is a great addition to the park with great food.  If you have pets (we have a shepherd) the dog park is so far the best we have seen in parks.  A large bonus is that the park is quietly tucked away from the traffic and noise, yet only 7 miles from beautiful Bonita Beach and Naples Barefoot Beach, and an easy ride (the back way,  away from the dreaded Fort Myers Bridge)  to  Fort Myers Beach.  They wisely hired an activities director this year which greatly helped in adding lots of fun activities to the park's monthly calendars.  We are looking forward to a longer stay in 2018.",
      "We stayed here last winter for a few weeks... we loved our stay. Employees  were always friendly ,helpful and working on something! They keep the place very nice! We loved the pool and close laundry mat. I love the flat fee(and bunch of washers were broken though... so that was a downside). They pi k up the garbage every morning.They spray for red ants and if new hills come up. We will stay here again."

      "My husband and I spent 6 months (Nov.-April) renting an RV at Naples RV Resort last year. That was some of the best money we have ever spent. We went in knowing nothing about RV culture, and everyone was as welcoming as can be. Judging by what other newcomers with RVs were saying, this place is really exceptional. Not even comparable to a Walmart parking lot. This place has character and tall trees that provide great shade. If I could buy there I would! The staff is great, too!",
      "what an awesome 4 day getaway. clean. quiet. groupon deal. very nice time with my lovely time and not too far from all entertainment but not too close to all the noise : )",
      "Stayed here for a couple of weeks in 2015. Here for 2 months now in 2016. This should be rated at 5 stars. The office staff is friendly and helpful. The maintenance crew is prompt, competent, and professional. There is a sense of community here. Everyone says \"Hi\". We love the trees and the landscaping. It's a fantastic place to stay and close to the beaches.",
      "Stayed here for a month in June 2015. Very nice place, within driving distance of beaches, shops, etc. worth noting that they also sell full-time spots. Enjoyed my stay.",

      "We love going to Cranberry Campground because of the views and the beauty of the place, the large campsites and the great staff who are always trying to be helpful to campers. The manager assures us that they are doing their best to be a family oriented campground, and provides lots of weekend activities for families, especially children, to participate in. They have theme weekends which are popular, nice facilities for laundry and showers, and a great, clean salt water pool with easy access for anyone to enter. The only down side to our 3 day visit this summer was the torrential downpour (try playing bingo in a metal building with monsoon like rains beating down), but it did resolve the campfire ban - and the mosquitos which were particularly savage this year. We'll be back for sure!",
      "Great view from a gravel pit. Sunsets are amazing. You'll be camping in a vapid wasteland. I was yelled at by some drunk jerk twice in the first half day. The second time to slow down after being ushered to speed up. I dare you (I dare you) to get through a few days without some idiot telling you to drive faster, to drive slower, or that you parked in the wrong place, generally with whiskey breath. My booking is on the heels of 61 days of camping in a row. This is the worst, without a doubt, the worst campsite I've been to. Pool closed. Wifi sucks. Bathrooms suck. Classic seasonal \"fleece weekenders\" setup. They don't want campers. They want seasonals and people to pay them so they have someone to yell at \"slow down\" \"hurry up\" \"why'd you park there\". That being said, ladies at the desk were wonderful and the view was amazeballs. Just get ready to get told stop or start doing something you are or aren't doing the moment you give them your money. Don't believe me, look at their rules list. Ask for it in advance - seriously - it will set the tone for what to expect. They don't want you there. They just want your money.",
      "Fantastic family campground. Lots of activities. Pool, laundry, playground, ice cream, etc.",
      "Good pricing for motorcyclist ;) notice a lot of mosquitos and hard to access WI-FI but I wasn't there for that!",

      "The owners were very courteous and helpful going out of their way to help us with a small repair to our trailer while staying there.We were touring the East Coast and used this site as headquarters for a few days while we visited the highlights within a 2 hour radius.Our site had a perfect view of the harbour and the campgrounds and comfort station were immaculate.We have already recommended this campground to our travel friends.",

      "Fantastic pit stop to or from Cape Breton.  Rest rooms and other facilities are top notch with the owners onsite to help. Our tentsite(T1)was overlooking the lake and was beatiful. We could hear some road noise from the nearby highway but it was not too loud or disturbed our night's sleep. Will definitely stay here again."

I must say this was my favourite one,  site was good size, gave full hook up, not much of a fire pit but could still make a fire in it. Two parks for kids, very friendly locals and visitors, seen a cable hook up for your tvs dident use it but thought that was a great feature to have, pool was out of service when we were there but looks nice, clean and safe for children. Looks like a rec centre on the property as well so more to do even in doors\n\nBeach is steps away and in view from campsite, long dock going out into the ocean makes for the most beautiful setting for the sun set which is in perfect view",

      "We are staying here for 5 days and using this location as our home base while exploring the area.  What a great location and a camp that is truly friendly with great owners.  There are many seasonal residents in the park with a generous number of transient spots for people like us.  The park has 30 amp service with full water and sewer hookups, all which worked well. The included WiFi is some of the best we have experienced on the road.  The whole park has a family feel.  \nIf you are in the area, this is your \"go to\" place that has reasonable rates.  Be sure to call as they can get pretty booked up in the high season.\nBe sure to check out the Virtual 360 walk-through photos of this park.",

      "We overnighted here in mid-June. We came away with mixed feelings after our stay.\nPROS: \n* Convenient location for the PEI Ferry\n* Hydro, Water, Sewer and Wifi hook ups all great\n* A great warm welcome, and a free icecream to boot!\n* Reasonable price, espacially after seniors and CAA discounts\n* Great beach - watch out for jellyfish\nCONS:\n* Very tired campground; scruffy and in need of some serious TLC\n* 90% seasonal trailers, which are crowded in over the whole campground\n* Disgusting washrooms/shower amenities; probaly not a problem for the seasonal users or travellers with really good bathroom facilities in their RVs, but just horrible for RVers who need to use the camp's facilities; in the mens washrooms, there was no soap dispenser, no paper towels or hand-dryers, and you could figure out what the previous toilet user has eaten for their last meal...YES, REALLY!\n* The overall all impression was one of owner's neglect; happy with all the seasonal users, and happy to take in travelling RVers who don't mind dirty and unhygenic facilities\n\nIt's a shame. This campground has tons of potential, and many good elements that would make it a great rehab project for an enthusiastic owner.",
      "We stayed at this campground in Pictou for 6 nights.  Did a lot of sightseeing the first few days and then just sat back and relaxed.  The camp hosts could not have been nicer and everyone was super friendly.  Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Don't know if I did this right or not as when I posted it didn't show I gave it 4 stars - But I did and it deserves this rating."

We cannot say enough good things about the site, the owners and the wonderful seasonal campers that have been there for years. We have made friends that we will keep in touch with for years to come. The owners Dennis and Preston go out of there way to make sure you are comfortable. They treat you like a guest in their home. The pool is also very clean and well kept and always heated to about 88 degrees.. This place is a must if you are travelling through the Maritimes and looking to meet some awesome people and have a really good time",
      "Spent the night here camping right on the rivers edge.  It was peaceful, serene and removed and any noises of life. There is a well maintained pool to hang out at and clean facilities to freshen up in. The crowd of seasonal campers are warm, kind and welcoming. It wasn't long before I was hanging out with them having a really nice time. When I wanted my peaceful alone time I just went back to my tent and was left in silence. The gentleman who run the grounds are also kind and sweet and actively ensuring a pleasant experience.Thank you Riverside club. Hope to see you again in the fall. I hear there are festivities on long weekends and holidays:)",
      "\n A pleasure to visit this pretty little spot just a short drive from the ferry to Prince Edward Island.  A garden really.  The poolside and common campfire are the social spots. Primarily for seasonal campers, there are a few sites for overnight, so be sure to book in advance.   We have no issue level parking a 28' RV in a spot right next to the river.  Electric and water hookup, and I understand full service later this summer. ('17)  The hosts treat us like gold.",

I wish I would have found this place earlier this summer.  Definitely going back !!  Even made some new friends. 😜.  ",

There is a recently fixed up pool (no diving board), tennis court (which may have seen better days) and other standard facilities. But the people of the campground is what makes the experience worth it...always there to help and have a friendly chat!",
      "Love this area of Cape Breton. Cottages are adequate, 2 BR. If you plan to stay more than a day and avail yourself of the kitchen facilities realize that there are only basics in the kitchen. There is no sponge for the sink, no salt and pepper, no oil or sugar, limited dishes. These are some amenities that would make the stay more pleasurable. There was tea and some coffee pot filters. Cabins and tennis court not as scenic as they once were, having been surrounded by RV spaces. I realize that this is the economic reality of tourism in CB. They also have camping spots and bathroom facilities for campers. With Nova Scotia taxes it was a hair under $200 a night Canadian, summer rate 2017. Office staff was very friendly and helpful.",

On the upside, staff was friendly and the facilities, although poorly ventilated, were adequate. ",

      "Kaş kamping de yer olmayınca karavan ile iki gece konakladığımız yer. İşletme sahibi Ömer abi iyi niyetli yardım sever. Karavanlar için kısıtlı imkanları ve yeri olsada elinden geleni yaptığına inanıyorum. En azından eksikliklerinin farkında. Çalışanlar mümkün olduğunca ortak alanları temizliyor. Maalesef arkasına bakmadan kirletenler yine bizler oluyoruz. Bu kültüre ayak uyduramayanlar kamping alanlarından uzak dursun lütfen. Bıraktığınız her kiri çöpü toplayacak kadar adam çalıştıramazlar. Kaş ta kumsal aramayın bu nedenle deniz kıyısı taşlı olsa da denizi harika. Kampta konaklayanlar için wifi şezlong şemsiye ortak mutfak buzdolabı wc duş ücretsiz. Tesis denize sıfır değil. Sahil ile aranıza karayolu geçiyor. Araç sesleri sakin ve sessiz bir koy arayanları hüzne uğratabilir.",
      "Tuvalet ve banyo temiz. Kamp alanı ile plaj arasında ana yol geçiyor. Plaj yeterli deniz harika. Çadırlara elektrik ve masa sandalye veriliyor. Mamgal yakmak serbest fakat bu sizi korkutmasın. Kötü bir mangal manzarası yok. Gündüz sıcak olacak gibi. Ondanda ya plajda takılın yada vünlük tekme turuna çıkın. Şimdiye kadar kaldığımız en iyi çadır kampı diyebilirim.",
      "İlk olarak 15 yıl önce tanıştığım bu güzel kamp hakkında tek diyeceğim vazgeçilmezim. Kendine ait müşteri kitlesiyle, kendine ait plajı restoranı ile mükemmel bir yer. Kaş merkeze biraz uzak araba ile gidiş mesafesi tercihe göre yürüyerek de gidilebilir. Kamp burada yapılır, yeni yapılan bungolavlar oldukça konforlu.  Burayı seviyorum sizinde seveceğiz bir yer olacak.",
      "Kamp sevenler için iyi bir imkan. Duş ve tuvalet gayet temiz. Elektrik var. Ortak kullanıma ait buzdolabı var. Yalnız çıkışlar 11:30 da yapılıyor bana göre çok erken. Bir de gecelik 50 tl ödüyorsunuz. Onun dışında güzel bir yer"

The name is actually taken from the Bushman Rock Art of the White Lady which is nearby and a very interesting historical site to visit.\nUnfortunately we were not blessed to see any of the desert elephant that are synonymous within the area, maybe next time",

      "This camping ground is just in front of Naruto Bridge, in the evening when sunset goes down is very beautiful view in here. This camping ground is also have private beach, but the water is not so clean. Because it's just below the highway,sometimes you can hear the truck sound. For people who want to do camping and beach activities I recommend this place for you. But for people who want to spent the quality time with great nature I'm not sure this is fit for you.! In here also you can do barbecues, doing fishing in day time or trough the night time, and also it has a lot of parking area. Just information, please make sure you have enough food and drink also dong forget to bring your first aid.! Because there's no restaurant or shop around here.! It's just a small village so it little bit far from nearest city.!",

      "高規格オートキャンプ場です。コテージ、トレーラーハウス、広場サイト、区画サイト、いずれも綺麗で必要なものは揃っています。\n当方は主に区画サイト利用ですが、電源付き12ｍ×12mの広く水捌けの良い区画はテントと少々大きな幕を張ってもかなり余裕があり安心です。炊事場は各サイトにはないので綺麗な別棟の炊事場を利用することになります。飲料水用のポリタンク必須です。\nペットの同伴可です。広場・区画サイトは全域、コテージの一部OKです(同伴料金要)。当たり前ですがリードによる拘束は要。でもペットも家族としてより高い意識で認識してくれているキャンプ場で好感が持てます。\n以前よりよく整備されたキャンプ場で有名でしたが、近年のグランピングブームにうまく乗っかる形でキャンピングエリアの縮小とコテージ増設を進めており、ハイシーズン以外のキャンピングは幕が少なくなって少々寂しいですね。\n場内には「じゃのひれフィッシングパーク(有料釣り堀)」があり鯛などの釣りが楽しめ、別料金を払えば3枚におろした魚をコテージやキャンプサイトに持ち帰りBBQなど楽しめます。ドルフィンファームでイルカと触れ合うことも出来ます。\nアミューズメントスペースも取り込んだ形のキャンプ場ですが、これらの利用料金はやや高めなのは否めません。家族4人でコテージに泊まり、海上釣り堀で釣りをした後にイルカと触れ合う、なんてことをすると結構な金額になります。\nお風呂は車で10分ほどのところに「南あわじリフレッシュ交流ハウスゆーぷる」があります。綺麗でお勧めです。食料品などの買い物は西淡三原ICに向かうR28の八幡交差点にダイソーなどが入ったショッピングセンターがあります。キャンプ場から15～20分くらいです。\n臨海エリアですが夏は無風な日が多く、テント内は夜でもかなり暑くなります。春・秋は過ごしやすく予約もいっぱいです。冬季も営業していますが、早朝は氷点下も多いです。但し降雪はほぼ無いためホットカーペット+対流式ストーブなどで十分楽しめます。\n冬キャンをしたことがない方はここから始めてステップアップしてみてはどうでしょうか。",
      "朝はパン屋がきてました。\n海にはイルカが飼われています。\nキャンプ場主催のイベントが結構あります。\n夏場以外はお湯が自由に使える炊事場があります。\nトイレを含め水周りは超綺麗です。\n真ん中に広々とした芝生広場もあります。\nスタッフもとても親切です。\n\n関西方面からだと橋代かかりますし、がっつりキャンプ満喫ではなく、淡路島満喫ついでに子供達とホテルの代わりにキャンプ泊って感じなら最高じゃないでしょうか。\n夕飯は是非淡路島の玉葱を使った料理に挑戦して欲しいです。",

      "SUPできます。ツアーのみでレンタルのみはありませんが、60分か90分のツアーがあり、少人数のグループでいきます。\n波は穏やかなので、すいすい進めます。\n鳴門大橋がみえました。\n\n更衣室にクーラがついていて、とても快適で助かりました。\n\nイルカに乗れる体験もできたり、キャンプもできたり、幅広いアクティビティが体験できるようです。",
      "年末にキャンプしました。オフシーズンは安くて静かでよかったです。しかし、爆弾低気圧に会い山から吹き下ろす風がすごく強かったです。隣の釣り堀は子供達には好評でした！管理棟に売りにきてるパンも美味しくて朝食にぴったりでした。"

Палатки стоят на открытом месте, сущее пекло. Есть магазинчики с товарами для пляжного отдыха. Самый дешёвый круг 400 руб, маска 500. Полно столовых и кафе. Качество еды не пробовал кроме блинчиков с творогом, пара 60 рэ. Очень вкусные были. Ну и компот...)",
      "Море прекрасное, камней крупных нет, но бьёт все мусор на пляже! Весь пляж усеян окурками битым стеклом и крышками от бутылок. Туалет это вообще беда, если в кафе или столовой то посетить возможно а вот на пляже мрак лучше близко не подходить. С питанием можно выбрать на любой вкус, есть уличные ларьки с хот-догами, столовые, ресторан (La Vela отличное заведение с хорошей кухней). Парковка по смешной цене, что удивляешься когда видишь огромные автобусы на обочине. Но сам пляж на один раз, повторно есть места и лучше (битое стекло оставило осадок, перед тем как брать плату предоставьте услугу уборки)."

      "Плюсы:\nОхраняемая стоянка\n\nМинусы:\n1. Места для палаток это Пыльная грязь, ни о каком газоне речи не идет.\n2. Душ доступен только с 20:00,а до 20:00 закрыт на ключ. Мы попросили открыть и сказали что мы готовы к холодной воде, на что нам очень грубо сказали что в правилах было написано что с 20 и нечего тут даже просить. И ключа у них нет и приносят его вечером \"специально обученные люди\". Бред.\n3. Туалеты очень маленькие, бумага не предусмотрена конструкцией. Когда сидишь на унитазе, голову нужно отклонять назад иначе можешь упереться ей в дверь которая немножечко в моче.\n\nЧто такое сервис и вежливое общение с теми, кто за него платит, не знают",
      "Кемпинг понравился. Можно жить в домиках, можно в палатках. Стоимость: 5$ с человека за сутки (июль 2017). Есть по вечерам (с 20:00) тёплый душ. Умывальники и туалеты работают постоянно. Рядом чистое озеро. Виды красивые! 5+ за вид. Рекомендую!",
      "Отличный тихий кемпинг, озеро в 5 метрах, много места под палатки, есть домики, но дорого. Сутки в палатке летом 2017 стоили  300р, домик на двоих в районе 2500-3000р.\nЕсть хороший туалет и горячий душ.",
      "Плюсы: \n1) Отличное рсположение. Кемпинг находится в лесной зоне,через дорогу прекрасное озеро. За 5 минут можно доехать до развлекательной зоны Абрау Дюрсо. \n2) На территории есть бесплатные мангалы, душ и туалет.  \nМинусы:\n 1) Грязновато. Не смотря на то, что персонал выдаёт отдыхающим пакеты для мусора, нашли много осколков и засохшие собачьи какули. Берег озера завален мусором. \n2) Слив в душе засорён, вода стоит по щиколотки. Горячая вода подаётся только  после 20.00. (Принимала душ в 22.00 - из крана лилась уже только холодная вода)\n3) Не рекомендую кемпинг для размещения на время уикенда, т.к. на отдых приезжают местные. Нам не повезло - рядом были барышни, которые \"гудели\" до 5 утра, стоял дикий смех и мат. Лучше приезжать на буднях - больше возможности выбрать хорошее место для палатки. На всякий, захватите беруши.",
      "Уютный кемпинг в лесном массиве рядом с озером Абрау. Есть общественные туалеты, раковины. Душ работает после 20:00 \"до последнего клиента\"."

Поэтому владельцам смартфонов, неподдерживающим 4G очень не повезёт.\nСпиртное продаётся с 11:00 до 22:00 часов.

Вход в воду крайне неудобен, но погружение плавное. Организована служба спасения на воде. Имеются различные водные развлечения.",

На этом поле есть 9 переполненных био туалетов, после того как вы туда сходите вы не сможете плмыть руки, так как умывальники находятся рядом с платным душем и чистым платным туалетом. Нет ни холодильника, не питьевой воды. Две звезды ставим только за очень хороший пляж, но в этом заслуги кнмпинша нет и за хороший отзывчивый персонал.

      "Решили съездить в Анапу в сентябре 2017 г. Задались вопросом поиска кемпинга, стали читать отзывы в Интернете. Это место сразу понравилось, а по факту всё оказалось гораздо лучше ожидаемого! В кемпинг заселялись в 3 часа ночи, круглосуточный заезд и помощь с выбором удачного места для стоянки гарантирована! Весь персонал \"Пляжного поселка\" был приветлив и вежлив. К плюсам кемпинга можно отнести чистую и ухоженную территорию с местами в тени для палаток; возможность подведения электричества к палатке; отличный сигнал для мобильного интернета (МТС); души с горячей водой в течение дня, туалеты; мангальная зона и кухня с посудой и всем необходимым для готовки; чистый частный песчаный пляж в ста метрах с песком, лучше которого мы вообще не видели; отличный бар и столовая на территории с адекватными ценами; снижение цен в несезон, отдыхали за 500 руб. в сутки с электричеством на двоих; возможность приезжать с домашними животными; вечерняя анимация для детей и спортивные игры на пляже для взрослых. Отдых очень понравился, уезжать не хотелось даже спустя 10 дней. Обязательно вернёмся в \"Пляжный поселок\" ещё не раз!",
      "Отдыхаем в кемпинге. Чистая, охраняемая, облагороженная территория, бывший пионерский лагерь. Есть подключение к электричеству. Детская анимация. Столовая - шведский стол, приемлимые цены. Нормальный, цивилизованный туалет. Душ с горячей водой из бойлера. Пляж рядом. Песок. Море мелкое. До глубины надо пройти. Хорошая инфраструктура в окружении. Из всех кемпингов - для меня - пока на первом месте. Недостаток - на мой взгляд, абсурдное требование не пользоваться походной газовой плиткой от газового балончика возле палатки, а надо идти в мангальное место ( а там не равернуться).  ",
      "Ребенок отдыхал с бабушкой неделю, номера тесноватый, но все есть. На территории общая кухня и столовая с приемлемыми ценами. Сами оставались в кемпинге на сутки, места много, есть тень для машины и палатки, каждые 50 метров умывальники, туалет и душ бесплатно, тоже чисто аккуратно. Море в 50 метрах, народу не много, пляж чистый. Есть аниматоры для детей, но как то слабовато. В целом, впечатления очень положительные, особенно для отдыха с палаткой",
      "Близко море. Собственный пляж. Охрана. Везде чисто. Для детей отлично",
      "Отличная база. Есть как уютные номера, так и кемпинг. На территории все возможные удобства"

      "This little pub is a hidden gem. We came across it on our way to Darwin. There is so much history about the area from WW11 and the pioneers. There is a museum across the road with lots of information about the 20,000 or so military personnel, including nurses who worked there snd the rail system. The staff are so friendly and make you very welcome. We even had a musical evening with the barman playing the guitar and singing for us. The caravan park attached is simple but comfortable and had a pink theme. \nAttached to the park, there is a great aviary, with so many different bird species, some cute little sugar gliders creatures and a rathet large \"jumping crocodile\". All in all a very interesting place to visit.",

      "POISON IVY EVERYWHERE!!!!!!, the pictures on line look like this is an awesome campground, and by the price for a spot per night we thought it would be good .... but the spots that aren't seasonal are small and once you dodge the poison I've just to get set up you will be harrassing your kids to stay out of the grass !!! \nThere was a solid wall of poison ivy 4 ft from our Outdoor mat , it was terrible!!!  The pool looks brand new and updated but it is nothing special,... and the new area with new sites reminded me of a dessert, barley any shade trees with little bushes full of poison ivy,, save your self some money and hassle and please just go somewhere else ,.... also there is a lot of rules to follow and the owners do enforce them .... all the time , like every half an hour somebody is watching so you don't do anything wrong , I don't think this is a bad thing as there is always rules to follow, it was just a little bit annoying . We had kids with us and weren't partying and drinking or being loud at all ... but it seemed like we were always getting told not to do something ! I will never go back",

We really enjoyed the Orioles and goldfinches- they were everywhere and abundant -- they made getting out of the city so enjoyable that we were content to sit for hours watching them.

The ice cream fast food takeout is a great way to stay out of the kitchen too. Loved it!",

      "We stayed for a few hours. There's quite a few things to do. There's camping. A lot of people fishing by the river. There's a viewing platform you can hike to at the top of the hill for a nice panoramic view (You don't need to climb up the steep path by the playground, there's a path starting near the bridge further into the park). Peacocks walking around. I believe I saw a water park too. Since this is a small town, most other attractions are within walking distance.\n\nMay, 2017",
      "While the service and people were great, the center sites are not. We have a 27 foot camper so they gave us a center site. Once we got it parked on the very edge of the site and opened our awning it was almost touching the next camper ( standard sized awning), no slides on the camper. there was one tree right over our camper that wasn't trimmed high enough and it nocked one of our vent covers off smashing it. My husband is very good at manuevering and parking and he had a lot of trouble parking because the sites are so small. There was also no shade in this site and most center sites. The outer ring sites are a bit bigger and nicer with some shade but are literally right on the steep bank of the river. I saw a guy backing up his camper trying to fit in his site and was sure he was going to go over the edge, so I guess some of those sites are tight to. They have squeezed to many sites into a small space. While sitting on your picnic table you could literally hold your neighbors hand. We decided not to stay because of the VERY close quarters. Also, if you have young kids you might want to rethink this campground as the river is so very close and very steep edges.",
      "Nice quiet campground close to lots of things to do. Small camping spots open between lots but well treed overall. Mostly gravel lots\n",
      "Clean quit lots for everyone too do right in town and if u like fishing its right there too.",

      "Very nice lake with clear water, BUT so so crammed,-they definitely made it the way to make as much as possible. Sites with water and electricity and only electrical. The latter $25, place full. They have damp station.\nI definitely DO NOT recommend this venue, if you like to chill, relax. People into your face, you can not sit at the site table as next vehicle parked as tight as 5-7feet away, forget to have a conversation with your family. Both sides. Both sides has little digs LOOSE, while i have 3 adult German Shepherds, luckily i mind them, itherwise woukd be no dogs for both neighbours. They just let them roam!! But ince seeing my dogs, they leashed them. All squashes and squized. We had no other option but stay on the way to Bruce, it was getting dark. \nThey have a landstripe \"beach\" that dogs not allowed. \n\nThe worst place we stopped at in 3 weeks' time."

I would have given it five stars but one person who was at the desk was very rude to a couple of people. A gentleman asked if they had any spots open and was told no. He pointed out that there were plenty that he could see. The response was \" I told you we were full what part of that don't you get?\" Also I was buying a large purchase and he was on the phone taking reservations while trying to ring me up! Paid no attention to me. The rest of the staff were awesome!",
      "Nice RV campground. Pull through Sites are pretty level and long enough for our 40' with tow.  Grass between sites, lots of mature trees and staff friendly. A little  $$ and some highway noise but a nice park.",
      "This campground is centrally located, well run, clean, and filled with nicest people ever. Heather, Harold and all the rest took us in on short notice after our truck broke down halfway to Yellowstone. Had to get help from the police and a wrecker to get back to Buffalo, where we had no place to stay. These people took us in and treated us wonderfully.  Beautiful town, great campgroud wonderful pool, immaculate facilities. We love you guys, can't thank you enough. God bless!",
      "VERY friendly and helpful staff.  Super clean and well kept grounds.  Clean 8\" deep pool.  Charmfully dated restrooms and showers that were well maintained and SUPER clean!  I had hot water at 8:30 in the AM!  Plenty of modestly priced laundry facilities.  The owners obviously take pride in their facilities!",

Most of the sites are extremely pretty and it's fun to climb the large rocks and enjoy the views. \n\nIt's a first come, first serve campground though, so make sure you come early... especially during the weekends. And BRING WATER. Lots of it, as it can get pretty hot out there. \n\nWe spotted lots of rabbits, squirrels, birds and foxes, which was great.",

I'm not sure how all of the other sites are, but this one did get a little rowdy with neighbors drinking, etc. they settled down during quiet hours. There's no water at the site, but you can bring and fill up containers at the entrance to the park. It was very full on the weekend, so go as early as possible and ask around for people leaving that day. "

Nice swimming pool,  large fenced in dog yard,  children's play area,  and outdoor kitchen. The laundry room is nice and reasonably priced. All areas are roomy and the campgrounds are situated in a lovely setting.  You just can't go wrong here. Cabins, tenting sites,  rv sites are all available and well done!",
      "My family thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Buffalo, WY KOA. Full hook ups, clean and beautiful view staying near the creek. Bathrooms and shower very clean. Place to put your trash and recycling too. Nicely decorated and very welcoming with beautiful flower pots! Owners Lisa and Chet and their staff are very accommodating and friendly. Will definitely stay there again! Love that this KOA is just at the base of the Big Horn mountains. Can go fishing and return to campsite for nice evening around the camp fire!  Thank you for all you do to make this KOA a wonderful stay! ❤️",
      "I stayed there last year. The owners were very good people.  I was looking forward to stopping by and spending a night there and chatting for a while.  The gal I spoke to told me there was only a \"Deluxe \" site available but there was no electric or water. I said ok, I understood  but at least needed to put water in my holding tank.  She told me there was a $20 for water. I asked her to verify that, she came back and said that was correct. SEVENTY FIVE CENTS FOR A  GALLON OF WATER???? ( I only needed to top off my tank, less than 30 gal.)  I  went elsewhere. I will NOT be planning to stop by in the future.",
      "Best KOA I have stayed in yet. Very clean and neat. Completely full but shows and grounds were in perfect condition. Staff very helpful with directions for local events. Sight are roomy and offer some shade. \n",

Flowering bushes between sites were beautiful.\nAffordable ($30), and management was very nice.  Only downside was the sand everywhere:  tough on diesel pushers and gets everywhere in the coach.",

      "Owners are not very friendly or helpful. Horrible customer service. We had no power and were told it was a fault in our motor home. It was however only a problem when we got a neighbor plugging into power. I told the maintenance guy, who is the husband of the husband wife owner team, that it was not a problem in the motor home and was giving a ground fault error. I explained that upon check in a heard him and his wife talking about the same problem at another site and he just said \"yeah we had a ground problem there.\" He concluded his \"help\" by saying \"well that's all I can do.\" So when my husband returned home from Joshua tree, I told him what was going on and he tried to get help again to explain it was an issue with their box. The owner didn't want to come back to our site to assist my husband, who wanted to have the rig next to us unplug so we could plug in their outlet to show it was not a problem with our rig. He told my husband he just got off work. My husband, being himself a business owner told him owners don't get hours to witch he responded \"oh no, I have hours.\" So my husband talked to our neighbor and used his voltage meter to determine that we did indeed loose voltage when the neighbor plugged in. So back to the office my husband went to explain again, this time with proof, that it was their issue. He once again got an \"oh well\" attitude from the staff. We had to move to another site and will have to move again in a day. So when asked for some compensation for the hassle of moving sites two times in 3 days, he said he would have to ask the boss. Mind you this was the same maintenance guy who said he was the owner. He did however tell us we could leave and he would refund us the rest of the nights. We gladly would have left but unfortunately there is no where else in the area. I would not stay here again as they put no value on their costumers but rather treat you like you are a burden."

Talked to the owner said he had a motel with campfires and made a great deal on a large cabin very comfortable for the family for once. The owners are very wonderful people and so pleasant to visit with gave us the greatest directions to Yellowstone Park will stop by again just to visit with these great people!",

They included a flat screen HD TV, mini fridge and tiled bathroom.  The grounds were well kept with an impressive courtyard with many trees, plenty of places to sit and free morning coffee.  The owners were super friendly and went out of their way to make us feel at home.  Well managed.",

We made s'mores and told stories. The kids loved it!\n\nWe stayed in the last 2 bedroom cabin down on the left. It was completely redone but still rustic. Nice bathroom and shower. \n\nKids room had bunk beds where my girls played and slept. \n\nWe picked up groceries and cooked in the full kitchen. It was so much fun! Both rooms had Tv and cable as well as wifi. \n\nIn the morning there was hot coco,coffee and pastries. \n\nI regret we only had one night to spend here! It was the best stay from all the hotels and other cabins we stayed in the entire trip. \n\nIf ever passing through there we will be staying again!"

      "This site is pretty removed from the main park and it's fairly close to town, but it's still a very nice, quiet little camp. The entire loop covers about a half square mile, so it's not as crowded as the other sites. And they also take reservations, so that's always a plus. The biggest downside is that you have to exit the camp and get back on the road to access the rest of the park. We stayed here the second time I went out to Joshua Tree and I wasn't disappointed at all. ",
      "My personal favorite camping site in all of Southern California, possibly the world. I've been coming here annually for the past 15 years. There is a reason reservations have to be made months in advance, but it's always been worth it. Great for kids and adults, hiking everywhere, and a rock-climbing paradise. Check out rattlesnake Canyon day area during the spring to see lots of wildlife, sculpted granite waterfalls and running water if you're lucky. Almost always allows bonfires. Toilets, recycling and trash are all easily accessible. Convenience store at the entrance has ice, Popsicles, and cold beer if it's a hot day. Running water only at the ranger station so fill up as you come in! ",
      "Great camp spot #34! Just on the other side of the JT National Park, these cool camp spots are nestled in some really cool rock formations. Great for bouldering. Book your spot ahead of time! They fill up fast! There is good privacy from other spots and campers. Complete with fire pit and bench.",
      "Fantastic camping location.  The sunrise and sunset views are spectacular, as is the star gazing at night.",
      "Big sites and clean facilities. You don't need to pay for a park pass ($20) to stay the campground. The \"wonderland of rocks\" is incredible and makes it a special place to rest your head. There are plenty of places to scramble up the rocks without bringing out all your climbing gear. Joshua Tree has fewer trails than your average national park and there is only one short 1 mi nature trail that leaves from this campground. But you can drive to a few other longer trails that are 2-5 mi away."

We stayed in site #5 and the sites surrounding this section had wonderful views of the rock formations and the campfire backdrop was a large formation making an wonderful evening memory. I believe that many of the sites are equally as great, but that is the only part that I saw. If you are there to climb then you will appreciate the large number of high quality climbs within a short walk of your site and parking area. There are no showers and the toilet is simple. If you must have a shower the sites are close to a town 15 minutes away.",
      "A weekend in Joshua Tree has been an annual event with The Crew since its birth, and we reserve campsites one year in advance. The first day is spent driving in, setting up camp, and playing on the rocks till the dinner bell rings. We may be hikers, but we serve up potlucks and eat up like an army. A very bad B movie follows dinner and bedtime is relatively early because the following day is The Main Event, the big hike. Hike reviews are available under the heading of Joshua Tree National Park and Fortynine Palm Oasis.\n\nI love camping here, even though I hang out till bedtime, then head off to the nearest hotel. Indian Cove is far enough from civilization that we don't hear all the hustle and bustle of traffreak, yet close enough that we can see the city lights and is about a 10 minute drive to town. It's where the only sounds you discover are the auditory sensations of nature; owls, coyotes, rodents, and the peeps you're chatting with. \n\nCampsites are empty except for picnic tables, BBQs, trash dumpsters and a toilet. But you don't have to camp, check the website for day hiking requirements.",

It looks okay to me and I think that the low ratings may be unfair.\n\nYes, it is an old faded CG and it could use a coat of paint and a makeover. The playground equipment is from the '50's and makes me think your kids better be up on their tetanus. I did not go in to the main building to look at the facilities so no comment.\n\nHowever, this CG looks just fine otherwise. It has mostly pull-throughs on a feather pattern and has many mature trees throughout. The gravel sites are close, but there seems to be ample room for slides, picnic table, and a couple of cars.\n\nMost of the units that I saw were newer more expensive MH's and 5th Wheels. There are a couple of old trailers on the backside (I counted 5 out of 80? sites) but all of their outside stuff seemed to be tight and tidy.\n\nI drove through on a Sat night and all was quiet. No crazy parties, no loose dogs, no screamers. I would not hesitate to camp here in the future, given the few choices in the area. I am attaching a photo to show that this place is not nearly as bad as the others say.",

Up to 40 people and eight cars are allowed on this campground and you need to reserve your date and pay the fee ahead of time. I believe the fee is $200-$300 for Friday-Sunday.\n\nThere is a beautiful meadow, a pond, and a small mountain just adjacent to the campground. At the campground there is a fire pit, picnic tables and a non-potable water source. \n\nThe reason for taking off a star: \nThe restroom is an open-top fenced-in enclosure with a toilet seat that has a hole under it. It was pretty disgusting, but most of us took a hike and a shovel into the woods to do our dirty business.\n\nOverall, a great campground with nice surroundings! Highly recommended."

      "We stayed in the park this past winter from Jan to mid March. At that time we had paid until the end of March. We were informed by Martha (manager) that we would be receiving a cheque, returning our damage deposit. After repeated emails and phone calls, we were told that the matter was in the hands of the management company: Cascade Corporate Management. I would assume that after four months, this should have been resolved. While there, we were told that plans were to upgrade the park for future rv business.......this does NOT show that intent. I will wait a short time and if there is still no response, a copy of this \"rip off\" will be posted on the 5-6 rv clubs we belong to. September 6/17 update. I received an acknowledgment letter from Jason McDougall, Cascade Corporate Mgmt. manager of Tamarisk rv. He recognized the delay in refund of damage deposit and stated said refund would be done ASAP. That was of July6/17. To this date.....no further response. Because of this disregard for his word and failure to follow through, I now believe that this park, and the management company that run it are very questionable and I would definitely NOT recommend any RVers to stay or support this company. Sorry for the rant but I believe this company is a complete ripoff. NOTE.......After many phone calls and emails, I was advised that the management that I had been \"trying \" to resolve our problem with, was no longer with the company.

      "Owners are very friendly and the bathrooms were very clean. When making reservation we asked for a more private spot and were told we could have a spot that opened up to nothing. When we got there the spot we were given opened to an intersection about 10 feet from our RV with vehicles and walkers passing by quite often. When sitting at our picnic table we were in view of and could see approximately 18 other campers. Far from the \"more private\" spot we requested. It is a nice park with nice people just a little too close to everybody and all the action for our liking.",
      "The campgrounds are very well maintained with level gravel spots. We were in a travel trailer but the facility accommodates everything from tents to large class A's. No one was using it but the swimming pool looked nice.  Bathrooms were clean and laundry facilities were nice. Two complaints that probably don't impact most people.  Showers are small.  I'm 6' 2, 220 lbs and I was bumping elbows with little room to lean over to get my head wet. Second is the lack of shower facilities for handicap. My wife was unable to shower here. \n\nIt's quiet here but it is a large facility with many campers.  ",

If you're looking for a peaceful nights sleep, don't waste your money here. I only give a 1 star rating because negative 10 is not an option.  Never again!"

      "Solid camping spot, the best spots here are on the perimeter, so you're not in the space of others camps, and get unobstructed views of the area. Being close to the Headstone climbing rock is a huge plus, we woke up extra early to be first on the rock, super important if you want to climb in cool weather. Otherwise you're stuck waiting for larger guided groups to take over the rock, and waiting turns. \n\nIf you expect a first come first serve site, I'd recommend getting there some time Thursday for the weekend, Friday everything is usually taken.

      "Nice campground with good amenities. Some campsites are practically on top of each other so if you want some privacy look on the outside of the loop. Great if your coming with a big group and renting a few sites, I guess.",
      "Convenient way to book a campground ahead of time. A little far away from the actual park entrance, but convenient for people who aren't particularly fond of true camping. Flush toilets and sinks are super convenient! Each campsite has a fire pit and grill attachment. Some even come with picnic tables.",
      "I'm not crazy about super developed campgrounds, but I wanted a reservation and this is one of three campsites in Joshua Tree that utilizes the always fabulous Reserve America. I'm glad we got a reservation because everything filled up by Saturday morning on a non-holiday weekend in February. The site fee is $15/night.\n\nThe shrubbery is pretty dense and does offer a lot of privacy if you get a good spot on the tent side of the campground. They all have a fire pit and concrete tables. There's flush toilets and running water. I mean, it's hardly camping, but that's good for some people. \n\nThe really lame part of this campground is that it's outside the park. This is not conducive to visiting attractions and then coming back to eat and then going out again. On the bright side, there's  a giant Wally World five minutes away if you forgot something.",
      "Very cool place to come for the day.  Or to camp for the weekend. It gets very HOT during the summer. About 115. So beware",
      "One of the worst maintained campgrounds I've been in. 20 bucks per night \"because it has water\". No paper towels, no dryers, you're supposed to wipe your hands on your clothes or your butt. The roads are in worse shape than some African countries. At one time in the past I got a reminder on the windshield for parking in a campsite to access / find a trailhead. All this while only 3 4 tents occupied the entire campground. Speaking of \"taking your job seriously\" Mr Ranger. Get out there and pick up some trash instead of cruising an empty campground and writing tickets to people who are unfamiliar with the place. Another issue with this Park is the inefficient dealing with visitors at the Quail Springs entrance. This Superintendent needs to visit other parks to see how they do it. End of complaint. "

      "Got here late at night didn't have to pay to get into the park and left early in the morning just after sunrise. Totally worth the trip.",
      "Camp #37 with a view of the Wonderland of Rocks and the flats where abundant spring wildflowers can be seen in between. The table and fire ring hidden in a shelter of rocks gives a sense of privacy from the northern Hidden Valley Camp Road.\n It's always nice to meet people from far flung places there to enjoy one of the most magical rock climbing areas of the west.\n",
      "Beautiful place. There's a ton of campsites so definitely worth checking out first. At night the camp fires light up the rocks so you get an amazing ambiance. Note there's no running water or electricity. The toilets are outhouses but what can you expect. Make sure to bring more water than you think you need. Also when first driving in look for the orange tags on the posts by the parking spot, that means the site is taken. ",

Vivek (owner) has put music system which you can enjoy during night. Can enjoy dip in river as you wake up which we did, though water was super cool. Overall great place to stay.",

      "I recently went here for a family holiday ... it's a nice place to enjoy and relax with family or friends. The hospitality was good and the tents and washroom clean and spacious. As for the view it is heavenly. Fishing for trout in the river is my fondest memory of this place. The only negative was that I think the were a bit short staffed so the service was slow , other than that it's an all in all good place to visit.",
      "Best place in Barot! Excellent view, wonderful tents, great food and a very nice and attentive staff. If you like hiking this is the perfect place for you since they also have Sher Singh who was the best trekking guide we had in India and took us to some amazing places! Thanks guys for making our stay so great:)",

It is not much famous so attracts very less tourists.The staff of this place is very friendly and the service, food to offer is very good especially the trout fish served here is very tasty.This Resort is situated just near the river with amazing scenery One feels calm at this place. This is a must go place for trekkers resort has guides for helping you out. A big thumbs up to the resort. "

A budget camp (no unnecessary frills or glamour) that is set in one of the most pristine settings available in Parvati Valley. 4 Kms short of Kasol and that means away from maddening crowd and noise. 50 metres from a young forest on one side and a fully grown forest on the other side and at a stone's throw from gushing Parvati River. And then is the unmatched hospitality of Ajit/Ajeet bhai ji. Common washrooms are in plenty, are kept painstakingly clean and have 24x7 running hot and cold showers. Finally, Parvin Negi's magical cooking and sipping own amrut sitting around a bonfire with light musik playing in the backdrop......WOW!",

      "Beautiful location, though quite windy and exposed as it is a peninsula. Toilets were very smelly and the bins were overflowing. Toilets are public toilets so not exclusive to the campsite. Lots of supplies left by people, good place to start and pick up camping gas and other foodstuff. Lovely beach and there is a cafe in the old lighthouse. ",
      "Plenty of space, very reasonable price, and the owner is friendly. Lovely views, interesting lighthouses, long sandy beach walks, and plenty of wildlife around. \nHowever, it loses a star on account of there only being two toilets which are not exclusive to the camping site - they're shared with the rest of the public, and therefore are in poor condition.\nBut a very pleasant place to stay as long as you don't mind the basic facilities.",
      "We camped at this site for two nights, spread by a week. The campsite is essentially a parking lot, with a couple WC's, and a non-functioning lighthouse. The sea crashes upon the rocks meters from your car. Both nights we slept here, the rain was moderate but the winds were heavy. The atmosphere was very pleasant, if you're open to nature. One of the WC's doors wouldn't close the first night, and I believe there was a tissue outage crisis one night as well; those are the reasons for the lost star. Keep in mind this is not a luxury site, but it isn't a poop-in-the-woods site either.",
      "Go there to get free stuff, when you start your camping trip. Seems most people camp here, the day/night before they fly home from Keflavik. We did the same, and left a lot of stuff we didn't need anymore (canned food, camping chairs, propane gas). Site only has two toilets. ",

Only 1 shower in the ladies room, but the shower and toilet facilities were clean and the shower was hot.  Free WiFi when you're close to the main reception building.  I would recommend stopping by here even for those flying into Iceland as numerous campers leave items (especially fuel canisters) here before the depart, as did I. I think of it is recycling because I'm not sure what they will do with all of those. There were literally like 20 canisters available. People also left dried food goods, which can be picked up for free.",

      "This little KOA is very nice. We were greeted at the door by the sweetest lady. Check in was quick and she showed us where everything was and made sure we didn't need anything else. Great customer service! The bathrooms were very clean. Also, we got a free cookie at check in and found out we also got a continental breakfast in the morning.",
      "Arrived early evening for a one night stay and welcomed by the friendly hosts and staff. Great campground with extraordinary views of the mesa overlooking Grants and surrounding areas. Lava rocks and volcanic soil surround the campground. Roads have ample space, hooks up were convenient and easy to use. Several areas to walk my dogs along with a great trail through the lava rocks area around the campground. Propane refill was a breeze. I would highly recommend this campground. The hosts and staff go above and beyond to satisfy travelers and campers.",
      "Overall fairly good place. Customer service decent, lodging is good (cabin). The bathrooms are ok. The showers are very small, but hotwater was no problem. Breakfast was good.",
      "Super friendly staff!  Clean sites and facilities.  Nice views of lava fields.  Free continental breakfast.  Sites were a little close to each other.  No pool and pretty small playground.  Very convenient to interstate.",
      "Great friendly and humorous staff.  The staff even delivered a fully cooked turkey dinner with all the trimmings.  Very dog friendly"

      "Bluewater Lake State Park is one of New Mexico's most beautiful state parks. The campsites are set between the lake and a canyon. There are 14 electric sites for RVs and only 7 of them need a reservation. All the electric sites are in the Canyonside campgrounds. If you have a tent or your RV has solar, the nicest sites (IMHO) are in the Lakeside Campground. It's not easy to tell which campground is which when you first arrive - they blend together. Luckily there's a map you can find where you get the permit for your campsite. There's a marina & boat ramp here and fishing with a permit. There's also a playground, 2 group shelters and some very nice trails. The park is very dog-friendly. There are flush toilets in the visitor center (near group shelter #1), but the other areas in the park are vault toilets. Unfortunately most of the electric sites are pretty unlevel. Horses come through the park most days to chomp on the grass and poop everywhere. There are very few spots for RVs bigger than 35'. We stayed here in a 30' motorhome in August 2017.",
      "Take exit 63 because google maps will take you to the other side of the lake where you cant access the campground. I had to drive all the way back. Other than that, it's nice if you can get there before 5 because the gates close :( No full hook up sites. Only electric. They have a dump station and water fill ups everywhere. Call ahead it fills up quick.",
      "Never even got into the park.  Directions app from the website took us to the wrong exit, causing us to arrive at 5:30 pm.  The park closed at 5pm!!  The sign at the gait read: park outside of the park and wait until the park opens again in the morning.  That is horrible service. I don't expect to come here again. ",

      "My parents came into the campground with a 20ft trailer in mid July. There was full hook ups for water and sewer. I came a week later with a large tent put on the same 'site', the price per night went up $42 per night for a total of $92 per night for the trailer and tent. My sister, her husband and newborn son (12 days old on arrival at the campground) rented a cabin for the week for an approximate cost of $900 for the week. \n\nThe campground only takes cash, so my mom went to confirm the total cost and was told $1732 for everything which was thought to be pretty reasonable. Went and got cash and to pay the bill and it had gone up by over $350 dollars!!!!\n\nWe weren't all that impressed with the campground upon arrival and were willing to just suck it up until the point we got the bill. When questioned about the bill the explanation was that the baby (12 days old) was not originally included in the quote. No joke, we had to pay extra for a new born. \n\nThis is the major complaint. Below are the items we were willing to overlook before this issue: \n1. In the cabin you have to pay $1 for hot water in the shower. This should be included in the price of the cabin rental. \n2. There are laundry facilities on site and they are very clean. But, the washer is $4 as well as the dryer $4. \n3. It is right on the lake but you can see it because there campers right in front obstructing the view. \n4. The lawn gets mowed at 10:30pm! Happened 3 times during the 2 week stay. \n\nConsidering the options out there for camping and trailers one would assume that owners try to be competitive with their sites and amenities gaining customer loyalty and positive reviews. \n\nWe collectively would not recommend staying at the Blue Bird.",

They also have a concrete pad topped with a metal roof that comes in handy during a flash thunderstorm. During warmer weather, be sure to remember that this is the empire of the ants. Not much you can do about them other than marvel at their industry. It's a small price to pay for the experience of laying in a star gazing tent looking up at the milky way and listening to the coyotes sing.",

You can hear the wolves, coyotes, and even large birds during certain times of the year.  Sometimes cows wander onto the area, which is fun!  If you park towards the outer edge, you get great views of the El Malpais.",
      "Hard to find but worth the trip. Google Maps will tell you that \"You have arrived at your destination\" about 10-11 miles south of the campground when you're traveling down NM-117. Drive farther - the campground is about 10 miles south of I-40 on NM-117. The entrance is on the east side of the road. There are 10 camp sites with a picnic table, a grill, and a fire pit. There are drop toilets and bear-proof trash bins. If you have an RV like we did (in July 2016) there are only 4 sites that will fit a 30 ft or larger RV. Max size 36 ft RVs. Only 2 of those sites look like you can get level. But the place is gorgeous and free! We enjoyed it and recommend it. ",

      "I recommend Rainbow Point Lodge in Perrault falls to anyone and everyone.  Maybe I'm a little biased but that's only because I just got back from an amazing trip where where I caught a 31.5\" walleye on only my second walleye fishing trip.  That's right.  Not only are Bob and Gale the sweetest hosts that truly care for their guest's experience;  and not only is their staff equally as accommodating (if you go this year,  tell George,  Shannon,  Janet and Weezie I sent you!\") And trust me,  they will do whatever they can to put you on fish;  and not only are most of their guests decades long return clients;  But one of the best recommendations I can give a fellow fisherman is that Lake Perrault has some lunkers.  I'll tell a quick fish story because everyone loves one. As true as my hair is brown, on the third day of my trip following what turned out to be a very insightful fish fry,  I caught my trophy fish.  After talking to Sandra and Lonnie from Iowa at the fish fry, I was told to try back trolling with a Lindy Rig and live leech.  Now I've never used a live leech before and truth be told I find them kind of freaky,  but my father and I decided to give it a shot.  After 3 hours of getting nothing but a few snags, we were starting to get a little discouraged.  After what I thought was another snag,  to my surprise,  i started to reel what felt like a concrete block.  As it came to the surface, I told my dad to grab the net (in somewhat colorful language I might add).  He missed it on the first swipe but nailed it on the second and luckily so, because the hook immediately popped out.  Check out their Facebook page because Gale posted the picture.  And the best part?  She's back in the lake for you to catch as well.  I'll soon have a replica and the memories of a trip of a lifetime. If you're looking for a great fishing hole,  with excellent accommodations,  an on premise store for anything you could need,  and memories like mine,  then look no further.  And if I still haven't convinced you,  we've already booked our trip for next year! Don't hesitate because you won't regret it.",
      "Our family had a wonderful time here on vacation. Lot's of good fishing, people and fun.  We especially liked the host's and their potluck dinner night.",
      "Very well kept lodge and grounds. Hospitable owners."

Staff were great and overall we had a fantastic stay.",

Situated is a nice park and along side Lake Kampeska. If you are looking for a stop off and are passing by Watertown, I highly recommend this Campground. It was worth the $22 a night for electric/water hookups. There are lots of spaces for campers and it is usually not to busy unless there is an event going on. In the winter the north loop is turned into a Christmas Parade of lights from local businesses!",

The 50 amp didn't work at our space but the 30 amp did.   It is on a busy country road that can be noisy at times, with ATVS, semis, speeding pick-up trucks and late night conversations.  (There is no barrier from the road.)  The managers are nice enough.  There are some guests who don't leash their dogs, and some who park wherever the want, in the space next to them (and next to you!) All in all though, an economical place to stay in South Dakota.",

We couldn't use our A/C, we tried and it dropped even lower!  Dated electric. Site 1⭐️, filthy, garbage on both sides, cigarettes, broken glass, trash!  The site was an uneven pile of gravel and the front of the camper dropped/sank .75\" overnight we were just able to get the landing gear up!  Cost $45. per night expensive for what you get. This could be a really nice park but our experience was horrible and we would not return or recommend to anyone who values their RV due to the electric being unreliable!",
      "We are staying here right now in a fifth wheel, for a week. This is so much nicer that most places we've stayed....especially Thousand Trail parks! Big spaces, all gravel roads, lots of deep wood chips in spaces....so rain with 3 dogs is not an issue with muddy feet! Nice clean laundry room with ALL machines working, and much less cost than most. Very helpful owners/managers as to directions and how to get around! Highly recommend you ignore negative remarks and come enjoy this nice quiet clean park!!",
      "So stayed here last weekend with my family August 25, 26, 27th 2017. Honestly I've read the reviews about this campground and it seems to me people either just like to complain, or something happened and things didn't go their way so they try and trash the campground through reviews. We had a great time here, it was not bad at all in fact we are going here to camp again this weekend. That being said 2 weekends in a row at same campground. We own a 26 ft pull behind camper. Campground is very clean, bath houses are clean as well. Park is great for kids. Staff left us alone and didn't intrude onto our site like other campgrounds I've been to. Pools were clean. However there is a few suggestions I will make. Please put some money into the arcade. It definitely needs some attention. And will attract more customers into the campground. Also there has to be a better way to place the fire pits. Placing wood chips around a fire pit is an accident waiting to happen. Other than what I mentioned this place is great. Don't listen to other people's complaints. If you are looking for a high class place then camping isn't for you. See you soon black bear campground",
      "This was conveniently located near the highway. The kids had a great time at the playground and pool with the tons of other kids!",
      "Good news first. Playground was good for the kids. Campground seems secure with the gate code required to enter. The folks in the office were nice enough. The sites seemed a bit close together but the place was not crowded so it was alright. Our problem came at shower time. Maybe they advertise the pay showers, but we were not told at check in and when shower time for two adults and 2 kids came, we were searching everywhere for quarters. We would have gotten change beforehand if we had known. Fortunately, another camper had two quarters that he gave me or I would have been unable to shower. Besides this inconvenience, why charge for showers if we already paid to stay here. This whole situation felt like a trick of some kind.  We have stayed at campgrounds all over the country, never found pay showers at a place where we were paying guests. It would get pricey to shower here for a family of four if we were staying the week. Good thing it was just one night."

      "My family and I had an awesome experience at Autumn Hills Campground!  We were late on booking our trip but we were able to secure the last site available.  The campers around us were nice.  The campground was clean, pretty and convenient.  My boys enjoyed the activities and they especially liked the Halloween  theme in August.  The hay ride, face painting and campground trick or treating was a real hit.  The bass fishing was fantastic on the lake and there were plenty of boats to choose from.  I was most impressed with how accommodating and pleasant the staff and owners were. They really seemed to be on top of things and were always available.  When i had an issue with my camper they went above and beyond to help me.  I'm looking forward to booking my next camping trip at Autumn Hills.   We are hoping to camp there again soon before the season ends.",
      "Best campground I have been to!!! People are wonderful!  Owners are very kind down to hearth honest people!! Only one small downside, some campsites are close to each other, But no one has ever had a problem that Im aware of :) Very happy hear! Smaller place very woodsy sites, more of a relaxed campground. Great for anyone really!!!",
      "I filled out a form online and they called us back and gave us a reservation last minute-which was nice! Although no sites open they allowed us to dry camp in a field for less than the regular rate.  Upon check in, they informed us we couldn't stay without rabies certificates, something I usually bring and we just Rv'd into Canada so I thought maybe I had the recent ones-but nope. I must have taken them back into the house.  So str ike 1. Strike 2 was when the site says they are on a lake and near everything-there's no way to access this place without 1/2 hour of back roads. We moved our son into SNHU last night and needed a place nearby-which according to GPS and their website , it is. It's not.  Twisty, windy back roads make for a difficult trip back and forth to and from the school.  When my husband checked out after spending one night in the field-we were charged an extra 50.00 for not cancelling 10+ days in advance-but mind you, we were also told we couldn't stay, and had made the reservations within 10 days so didn't have that window to begin with.  There is nothing on the site about dogs rabies certs-when I approached the desk to report this, they stated it was \"Ridiculous\" to put information about dog's rabies certs on their reservation info on the website. Be aware-no easy access, no dogs unless you've got paperwork.  These two things would have been very nice to know prior to being hours from home, with a busted windshield wiper that broke in half, during pouring down rain.  The desk said they won't allow anyone to camp in their field ever again.  I guess we were in the wrong to not call and ask about the rabies-however 99.9% of campgrounds don't ask for it, not even Fort Wilderness at Disneyworld.  I got a refund-only after I insisted-imo, this was both fault of the campground and our mistake-next time, I will ensure I get this information! Next time, I won't book for a week, either.  Campground is decent, although we didn't see much of it.  My husband said upon check in the staff was not welcoming at all-so I'm not sure why that was.",

I was surprised when the door opened....not a light on inside I called out shocked I heard a man respond. Definitely Bates Motel....did not stay this place was hideous!!!",
      "We stayed at this place a number of years ago when our kids were young.  I think they were a KOA facility at the time.  The owner was like  Dana Carvey character from a Saturday Night Live sketch,  a little like a combination of the \"Church Lady\" and Seinfeld's \"Soup Nazi\".  We were there in part to visit Tangier Island, but she did her best to try to convince us there was nothing to see there, we'd be deeply disappointed and that we'd be much better off taking their cruise to Smith Island.  She was snoopy and intrusive and we vowed never to return.  P.S.  The rave review from six year ago has got to be a plant.  Beware my friends!  Beware!",
      "Absolutely the rudest people to talk too.moved our reservations because of a conflict which is allowed per their contract confirmation. \"Mary\" said when we called to confirm our new date, we'll you didn't show you lost the 3 days. $180.00 gone. Buyer beware this place is a sham and a scam",
      "This place is a horror film nightmare like the movie Pyscho you want to avoid at all cost. The locals could tell you how unpleasant the mother and son run camp is. Campers just want to leave so no one ever takes them to court for failing to maintain health standards. Everyone hopes they will leave but the camp is to debilitated for anyone to buy it. Nobody with a once of self respect would do business like this. They don't even have the money to fix/replace the sign on Route 360. They are the eyesore of the county. ",

Each time I went to the office they had advice on what to see and where to go. We found this site to be very easy to use as our home base while visiting Boston & Salem.",
      "This is our favorite place to escape from Boston during camping seasons.  Quiet, beautiful ocean nearby, friendly helpful staff, good prices and relaxing.   You need a quarter for your shower.  It is rustic and i guess that is the point.  Love it here.",
      "Expensive for what it is. On the side of a hill. Hard to get into spaces. No cable, little to no tv signal. No Sat signal. Small curvy roads in area. Campground not well-maintained. Hookups in odd places.",
      "The tent sites can go either way. Some are small and clustered together, others are bigger and more secluded. The roads are very rocky and narrow. Some sites you actually have to back out of and down the dead end roads, because there is no room to turn around. The bathrooms are clean and typical of what you'd find at a campground. Wingaersheek beach is less than a mile away, and the campground sells discounted passes. With all that being said, it's a nice, well run campground and I'd probably return to camp again sometime ",

      "A good camping experience for all ages, the camping store may not provide every thing you may desire. I suggest you bring most of what you need. The pool and water park are cool, calm, and collective. As you find your self at the camping restaurant which serves typical good food . But all and all the camping sites, views, and experiences are great. Everyone is open and welcoming. Great for summer trips",
      "We absolutely love Tall Pines Harbor!!! My 9 and 3 year old boys have a blast and so do their father and I! I couldn't say a bad thing! It's far enough away but close enough to everything. We enjoy going to Chincoteague and spending an evening there walking the island. Then we come back home to camp!! My boyfriend's favorite part is driving the golf cart around. It's a great place for everyone! Clean, friendly and affordable!!! We just left one day ago and already can't wait for next year!!! The staff does an amazing job maintaining and running the grounds. You guys rock!!!",
      "So beautiful. The trees and beach and the Sound. Very well maintained. Very clean. Staff very helpful. Quiet and peaceful. We were here mid week. Could have stayed a week. Christian!

Spent 2 days inside camper because water outside was ridiculous. \nThe flies and mosquitoes were insane.  I also brought it to a staff members attention.

      "We camped here for labor day weekend. The facility and grounds are great. Staff was nice. From the time we pulled in in the pouring rain. The staff led us to our site and helped get us on the site. No complaints at all. \n\nMy biggest complaint and what would keep me from going back,,,,,,. THE GOLF CARTS ARE OUT OF CONTROL!!!!!!!!!  My wife and i were literally afraid to let our kids ride their bikes. They are speeding up and down every road with music blasting. Most look to be kids under the legal driving age. But its definitely legals and grownups too. Im one to have a good time. But it needs to shut down and be a little more quiet at quiet time which is 11. That being said. We already have a weekend reserved for the Oyster festival which will not be ideal camping there either. So we always give places a few chances to impress ",
      "We had a great visit. My parents own a cottage there and have enjoyed it for many years. We stayed in their rental cabins that were very clean and had every amenity that we needed for our stay. They have a small general store for goods so you don't have to leave the park for most items. But if you do, there is a grocery store very close by. They do have large pond and beach for swimming and a pool and water park. There is a boat slip too. If you like to enjoy the peace and quiet, I would suggest the weekdays. The weekends tend to be very busy.",
      "Was there on Labor Day weekend. They did an excellent job handling the crowd. Of course the grounds and facilities are top notch. Only complaint, and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is that the staff didn't enforce the \"quiet hours\" rule on Sunday night (remember holiday weekend).  Several groups camping near us played their music very loud and did not turn it down or off at 11pm.  Otherwise we had a great weekend. ",
      "If you are camping at Bethpage and planning on going to the water park, I strongly urge you to use caution. There are hidden dangers.  I was injured there three weeks ago and still in pain. The red and yellow water slides land into a shallow pool. No instruction on how to properly ride these slides is provided by the staff or signage. I rode the red slide down on my back, feet first, which I thought to be a safe way to ride. I landed in the pool and hit my knee so hard. Needless to say, that was the first and only time I rode that slide during my visit. I also found the painted concrete on the pool deck to be very slippery. None of us fell but had a few close calls, even not running. I did make the campground aware of my injury. The lifeguard gave me a bandaid. The management gave me nothing but a \"well it hasn't happened before\" which I find hard to believe given the shallow depth of the landing pool from such a large slide. \n\nMoving on - if you are going to the campground, you will enjoy nice large sites and a cool party atmosphere. There are golf carts everywhere. You actually will need a golf cart to enjoy that aspect of the campground. There is a limited number of them and you can't reserve ahead of time so if you don't get there early you will be out of luck. If you don't get one or don't want to add $50 to each night of your camping bill, refer to my warning above because when you injure your knee at the water park and getting around is difficult, you'll be limited to your campsite unless you're lucky enough to know someone else with a golf cart. \n\nYou want to definitely visit the mini golf and ice cream shop. They were both great. But again, a golf cart is a must here or you will be driving your car/truck and leaving the campground to get there. \n\nDo avoid the pool side cafe. The service and food was terrible.",
      "We drove 7 hours from New York to here. The park is awesome and there's a lot to do. But be warned. There are no restaurants or anything within close proximity. A good 45 minute drive to any civilization."

If biking and kayaking are not your thing, the park offers a small beach area for swimming and lounging on warm sunny days, as well a pavilions for picnics.They also offer daily activities for the whole family, such as ice cream making and butterfly catching! If you enjoy fishing, there was a nice pier to utilize and enjoyable nature trails to explore. Belle Isle is a great place to Geocache, with many challenging and fun hides. All around a great place to experience! "

      "Though it may not the fault of the campground operators, there is a great number of aggressive raccoons (and a skunk) that frequently visited the tent sites all through the night. We hardly slept at all and day plans were foiled. Equally as annoying (yet less frightening) were our loud, inconsiderate drunk tent neighbors who used profanities that would make a sailor blush (2 x-sailors in fact). This could likely have been remedied if curfew was enforced. We attempted contact to report the conduct, no one came. We requested a refund, which was granted. The night at this camp was the worst of our family vacation. The reason I gave 2 stars, not 1 is due to the apology that was offered and the refund granted.",
      "We stopped here on our way from Philadelphia to Acadia National Park and wow what a treat! The campground is located on an old coast guard island and there is a large abandoned sea plan hanger in the middle of the campground which makes it a little eerie but cool non the less. What I did not expect was the beautiful views and all of the awesome little beaches and rocks to climb and trails to follow. It was truly a unique place but one of the neatest that I have been too and I would have loved to stay longer but we plan on going back again sometime for a long weekend!\n\nShort less than 10 minute drive into downtown Salem. Friendly staff. Clean facilities. 5 & 6 year old sons had a blast and could have easily spent a few more days exploring the area. Really unique campground but definitely worth checking out!",
      "My rating of 5 stars applies to only 2 tent sites: 26 & 27. They overlook the harbor and have a bit of privacy. The other tent sites have no privacy and/or are a hike to the bathrooms. The RV sites are, as described in other reviews, essentially a parking lot. If you can overlook that, the campground as a whole is incredibly scenic, is convenient to Salem as well as Boston (in season, a ferry runs from downtown Salem to the park), and is a find. ",
      "An unknown gem right in Salem harbor and 40 minutes from Boston. 30 amp and 50 amp with water and dumping station offsite for free use. Some sites right on the water looking at the harbour with sailboats a plenty. Remember though the water sites are a paved parking lot and the non water view sites or traditional. The bathrooms are clean enough but could use modernization. Small sandy beach but not really swimable due to lots of seaweed but good for kids if just shallow. I would definitely recommend this campground",

      "Stayed here on a recent trip back from Provincetown.  One of the owners at check in was very nice, professional and friendly.  We were then escorted to our site and so thankful for his guidance and direction backing in our large travel trailer.  He's obviously done this many times before and we so appreciated his help.  Would definitely recommend this place.  Thanks again for making our stay so enjoyable.",
      "Friendly staff.  Beautiful, heavily wooded site.  GREAT restrooms & showers.  Our trailer site was roomy but muddy (because of the rain).  Lots of trains during the night, but we would definitely stay there again.",
      "What a wonderful campground!  It is immaculately maintained and layed out amongst the tall pines.  Our fireplace was made from local large stone and was very unique. Unfortunately is started to pour shortly after we completed set up and dinner so we were not able to venture to far from our campsite.\n\nBe fore warned that the mosquitoes are out and looking for you.\n\nThis is a campground I would like return to and stay more than a night.",
      "Very nice place, nice staff, nice pool. They do not play around with non registered people being loud or having to many people at one site. That's great. Nice laundry mat. Best shower I've been in so far, & the cleanest.",
      "We Stayed a couple days in a cabin. Loved it. Real cozy. I think they could use better beds, but it is what it is. Complete package. Fire pit, BBQ grill, roof a plus a/c. Definitely doing it again. "

      "Total complete and utter dump for the tent site. It doesn't seem appropriate to call a tent site at all. We saw a bunch of crappy trailers with some suspect persons living in the trailers directly in front of supposed bath house. There is no shade except stumps. We did not get out of our car and went back to request a refund. Fortunately, there was no hassle to get my money back.",
      "We arived on a Thursday evening,we rented what they called the high riser ..we pulled up to the store slash office the guy told us the door was open and waiting on us .To come pay in the morning we said okay, went into the trailer and got sheets on beds off to bed we go ,next morning wake up to ants everywhere it had just rained so we chalked that up to the rain the owner or someone brought flying bug spray and some ant bait to put around,it's now Friday we're up and looking around cob webs and cigarette ashes in kitchen cobwebs in bathroom and bedroom with a stale smell of cigarette smoke and something else not sure what it was ,I'm a non smoker with had lungs would not have rented this place just for this alone ,but we're here now so let's just make the best of it .. Saturday the toilet clogged up so it gets plunged ,go to take the trash out and no trash bags so I go buy some for trailer and coffee filters too...so Sunday rolls around and I go to use the restroom and fall through a plastic heat vent,proceed to call owner to let them know that one I'm injured and two now there is hole in the bathroom floor ,she says to me I've never heard of such a thing... doesn't come fix the hole til next day I start looking around and see all the vents have covers to small for the holes ,meanwhile I've got a crushed sprain and a  pulled back ...I'm still in pain and don't know when I'll be back walking without crutches....SMH .not even a check up phone call to see if we're ok from them",
      "I did an Airbnb rental in this campground... The trailer/cottage that we stayed in was very nice and the owners of this perticular dwelling shows pride in ownershipbut the campground itself is a total dump. \nThe owners (of the campground) should be VERY ashamed of themselves for letting a beautiful waterfront property turn in what is a total slum area... some of these people living here are \"not\" campers but more like squatters... and the place if crawling with feral cats ...It's a disgrace that anyone would be so disrespectful of one of America's most beautiful waterways... \nThe chamber of commerce for Chincoteague island should step in and sanction the owners for there neglect... \nIf I had any say... I'd rip this property from the owners and send them packing because they obviously have no respect for the sanctity of the bay, the island, the people that patronize the campground, but mostly for themselves... \n\n         SHAME ON YOU !!!",

A family of blue heron's, Hawks, Swan's swimming around the lake. And if you're lucky. The Eagles will put on a show for you. In my eyes Berry's is a nice place to visit if you want to go through Massachusetts. Forgot to mention the beautiful sunsets shining on the lake at night.\nThen it's time to call it a day!  😀❤",

They do have activities listed that they seem not to know anything about like the tie dye shirts and build a rocket.

      "Be careful when you book here as they have two separate camps.  A slightly cheaper and quieter side and a more family oriented side.  We did not know this when we booked and the kids were a bit disappointed to not be able to use some of the fun areas on the other side of the camp.  However the tent site we got was very nice but was right up against the road so you had traffic noise until 9pm or so.  The facilities were well maintained and while the  pool was a bit small there was no one else there so we had it to ourselves and it was right next to the tent area.  All in all a good value for the price. "

      "Love this campground. I have been 6 times. Reasonable rates. FYI its OK to take/scavenge for downed trees/firewood here as it cleans up the campground. Sites are cozy and clean upon arrival. I'm sure you will enjoy your stay. I will be going back to Wompatuck until I can camp no more. ",
      "Camped here about ten years ago,  passing through the area again didn't hesitate to stop again. What a huge surprise to find a whole new campground.  Plenty of walking trails and competition off road bicycle track/trails. Shower stalls were small fiberglass units where at 5'2\" I could not raise my arm up straight above my head. Stalls needed shower curtains cuz water sprays out into your dry dressing area. Bathrooms were very clean.  Park is like a 3 mile bike ride to Ferry that can take you right to downtown Boston waterfront.",
      "A good place to go camping. Things were quiet and we enjoyed 2 nights there. The bathrooms were a bit dirty and weren't cleaned at all during our 2 night stay, but otherwise I would recommend this campground.",
      "A great almost free vacation for a spontaneous weekend or for a week. Lots of hiking, mountain and road biking and rollerblading for when you're not hanging out by the fire pit. Don't forget to donate when you make your reservation. State and National Parks desperately need your support. ",
      "Sites are good, wide and level. Only 20amp power. They overcharge out of state visitors. They have recently raised the out of state price and I think it is having an effect because a huge section of the place was empty, even though it is the middle of the summer. Almost everyone we see he is from Massachusetts and there is only a few of us from out of state. We would have stayed longer, but it is annoying they charge 50% more if you are from somewhere else."

      "I am staying at Sunset beach resort South of this Campground!!!!!!! I was looking around the area and found the Cherrystone family camping resort . I stopped in at security check point and asked if I could tour the faculty to possibly stay at in future. The guard pointed me to the check in office where he said if I put a $20.00 deposit with drivers license I would be able to tour facility . \n     I stepped into office and asked if I could tour but I didn't have cash on me. I offered a credit card as collateral . The desk clerk would not accept. I asked if she could ask a manager who was seated 4 seats down and she declined. This was just to Look at the facility. The cash or credit card would be returned after someone viewed so what is the difference Cash or credit?\n  What poor customer service . I will now never stay at this facility because of the poor reception!!!! \n To all I recommend Sunset beach resort just South of This location . Private beach with pool and entertainment ",
      "Stay here every  year and looking forward to the two more weeks we have reserved.  Generous campsites.  Plenty to do for the entire family.  Campsite are easy to get to.  Staff and management very helpful.  Bathrooms were brand new and immaculate.  Store had very reasonable prices and everything you may need.  I'm sure someone could find something to complain about, but you wont please them unless you hold their hand the entire time they are there.",
      "We were really excited to stay, unfortunately we arrived on a rainy day. We asked at check in if the campground was clear for us to drive our 36ft RV safely to our spot without getting stuck and the lady on check in said she hadn't seen the campground that day. We were concerned about getting stuck in wet grass, what we found was worse. The park was at least 50% under water. We drove through roads covered in water straight back for a full refund. Thankfully I think they realized they were out of line not being honest and gave it to us no questions asked despite their refund policy. ",
      "My girlfriend and I rented a deluxe cabin for 6nights/7days.. The cabin was dirty upon arrival. Sand and dirt on the floors and ants we're all over the countertops. The beds were VERY uncomfortable to sleep on. We left a day early because we couldn't hardly get any sleep all week. We ran out of toilet paper and had to buy our own. We were only supplied with two rolls for a week. \nWe weren't allow to get the gulf cart until the day after we arrived and had to bring it back a day before we were to leave. \nThe fishing was horrible off the new docks. The docks aren't as long as the old ones so you end up in to shallow of water to catch anything. Also they left the old dock under the water so if you cast straight off the end of the dock your going to get snagged and loose your rig. We fished for five days on three of the four docks (1,2 & 3) and never caught much more than crabs.\nOther that those issues the views were the best in the world, the staff were very friendly and the pools were awesome. It was very relaxing and I would come again but we will wait until we have our own camper and cart next time.",
      "My family had a great time here. There were a lot of activities for the kids and family. So much fun fishing, crabbing, and the wildlife was really cool. We saw a dogfish shark, rays, and different types of fish. Our site was right next to the water, so we got to enjoy the low and high tides right at our doorsteps."

      "Great campground that is very close to the ocean as well as a couple other cool towns, such as Newberryport and Portsmouth. Campground is kept up nicely and offers some nice sites, although some are more private than others. Bathrooms are available and cleaned regularly. Campground staff is pretty strict with rules, such as making sure fires are out by 10:00 PM. ",
      "The friendliest campground we have ever been to! I've never met more welcoming people! There are not too many place that you can take your 140lb. dog and be greeted by many workers throughout your stay with treats in tow for him:-) Our site E14 was beyond perfect. I definitely think it's the best tenting site they have to offer. Everything is within walking distance around the campground so you don't have to drive. The little coffee stand in the morning is a great plus. The trading post has all the essentials you may need if you forgot to buy something. They have ice cream socials and pancake breakfast on certain days. Our friend dropped her purse by the garbage station and somebody was even kind enough to bring it to the trading post hoping for her return! The location is on point. Short distance to Hampton, Smuttynose and Throwback Brewery, cute town of Essex to name a few. There is a wonderful little farm stand on the same road that also offers ice cream with some being made from their crops. This was our second time back and we enjoyed it so much we booked another extended stay for this August and next July!  Thank you for the wonderful experience Wakeda!",
      "Nice, clean and quiet.  I would return.  My two criticism is make sure you understand your bill and because we slides on both sides, slightly wider spaces preferred.",
      "Wakeda Campground is a great Family Campground!   Lots of things to do and they have activities for the families.  They have seasonal sites, tent sites and cabins.   Great for those without children as well.  This is the cleanest and friendliest campground I have been to.  Have fun.",
      "Our stay was for a week in early August 2017. First the pros: This campground is very clean, conveniently located, the sites are well laid out and properly equipped with full hook-ups and the staff are friendly and engaging. And now for the cons: No WiFi (save for a weak signal in the camp store), no cable (and only OTA stations are a few public TV channels - verified with other campers) and NO ACTIVITIES. No BINGO, no hay rides, no pot luck dinners - nothing to bring folks together. And one more MAJOR negative that the campground should inform campers of - upon returning from our trip we spent three hours removing tree sap from our SUV. It was probably not totally avoidable without a car cover (which a number of cars of seasonal campers were using) as the campground is HEAVILY wooded, but if we were aware of the problem we could have been more selective with where we parked. All in all - not bad enough to want a refund but certainly not a place we will visit again."

      "After our arrival we realized we were put right next to a camper when there was several different sites that were available. Very few people were there considering it was the last day of the season. The neighbors made all kinds of noise during the night past quiet time (10pm) Get up the next morning found out that we had to pay for taking a damn shower For 45 dollars the shower should be free. If l knew how my night would of turned out ahead of time  I would of stayed at the holiday inn It's also near a busy road Might as well been the interstate ; had to listen to the staff's golf carts policing the grounds all night long !!! Never again- $50.- lesson learned !",
      "Not a \"happy camper\" they put us in the smallest camp site possible, you can barley fit your car (glad I didn't bring my truck) and way to close to other campers. Should be more room separating campgrounds. I didn't feel safe with being so close to the campers Next to us. Roads are loud in the morning and at night. Fires out by 11 is to early. 25 cents for 5 minutes to shower(don't try to make it 10 minutes because it will eat your quarter........ fire wood isn't seasoned and doesn't burn well. I will be going to black bear or tide water next year.",
      "Rustic yet comfortable. Short drive to shopping or the beach. They have a pool and arcade. Plenty of tree coverage. Gated entry. OK restrooms and showers. Pay by quarter showers are a little weird. ",
      "This campground has nice large spaces, it is pretty, there is a pool, bocce court, shuffleboard, court, horseshoe and basketball court. There is a game room also so if you have kids there is plenty for them to do. A laundromat is available on the property.  We enjoyed our stay here.",
      "After reading all the reviews and finding out that most of the four star campgrounds were all booked we decided to stay here. This place is missing that extra touch. The main bathroom/showers in the office are OK and somewhat clean however, the other bathrooms/showers around the campsites don't have full closed doors At night all the lights are on and all the bugs fly in. It was one of the most disgusting bathrooms I've ever seen and felt ill while showering. This easily can be fixed with a screen door. Make sure to bring your own firewood because the firewood that they sell is either not seasoned and/or wet and does not burn at all. Some of the roads are gravel and can be fairly noisy in the morning or at night. Some of the amenities that we liked was the really nice swimming pool ( 8 ft deep with standing ledge inside the pool to stand on which was a nice feature and the use of free mini golf (however the minigolf hasn't been kept up for some time, there were some numbers missing as well as some of the surfaces were not in the best condition to play ) but it is free.  There's is also free shuffleboard, horseshoes, basketball court, and an open field to throw a frisbee or anything else. If we were in a pinch again and needed to stay in the area here, we possibly would, but we would just be mindful of the things we mentioned above. "

      "Our 1st visit and we will be back all the other campers were very friendly, the park layout is nice, and inviting. We did not bring our golf cart on this trip so we rented one! The weekend events for the kids were a blast even in the rain our kids never got bored very family Oriented and clean. DO NOT let their prices be a deal breaker even though they are more expensive then the surrounding camp grounds I feel the extra $$$ was worth it and our stay wasn't over priced enough to make us not want to return. On a side note,\nWe bought our 1st camper 1 week before our visit here so my husband and I were new to all of it a lovely staff member named Lee was more than willing and happy to help my husband and I set up our camper and when it was time to leave again Lee did not hesitate to take us under his wing he even got hands on with helping us dump our tanks and thats not a job anyone wants to do. Great stay looking forward to our next visit. ",

We arrived late due to vehicle trouble, approximately 1:00am. Mark from guest services met us with a Golf Cart when we arrived led us to our sites and helped us hook up in the dark!

I completely agree with the rules, walking speed, fires out by 11, noise curfew, etc. but these people are downright nasty about enforcing them. And the awful experiences with rude treatment at the front desk and on the phone abound as is evidenced by the reviews they get. I took my 82 year old mother there not long ago at her request and asked the woman at the front desk if I could drive her through to get a look at the place, as she is handicapped and can't walk far, so she could decide if she might want to stay there or not with a friend of hers that wanted to go. I was told by the woman in a matter-of-fact tone that she could walk through only. I told her again that my mom was handicapped and couldn't possibly walk the entire distance, and was told, coldly, that it didn't matter. Not sure what they're afraid an 82 year old woman might do that wouldn't meet with their approval, but well, OK then, fine, we won't be staying where we're obviously not welcome. I'm glad my mom was turned away, I don't think she would have been happy there.  The management are not people persons, which, in my opinion, is a must for a campground, but they've been in business for many years operating as they do, probably making money, and don't care who they insult, turn away or treat poorly, as they've apparently done hundreds, if not thousands, of times since the campground has been there. Let them behave as they will, but I won't go there. I keep a boat at Rye harbor and am a six months out of the year local. These folks have a bad reputation with the locals. That should tell you something. There are plenty of other good campgrounds in the area. Try Sea Coast RV and Camping Resort (formerly Shel-Al), which is where we've usually gone since the early 1970's, and since it's close to Rye harbor, and is clean, modern, the people there are always pleasant and helpful, or one of the others, like Wakeda. Salisbury Beach State Reservation is great, too, if you can get in. Book early if you want to go there, it's always very busy during the summer season. If I could give Tidewater less than one star, I would.",
      "My friend and I needed a tent site for a night on our road trip. They wouldn't let me make a reservation. Upon arrival, (6pm) (they close at 8)  the female owner literally told my friend and I, \"Are you checking in? Then get your butts in here. I'm leaving!\" I was stunned by her rudeness and lack of professionalism. \n\nStepping into the office, all I saw on the desk was taped signs saying \"NO this, NO that!\" Very aggressively. She basically interrogated us before letting us in. Telling us 3 times that you have to pay for showers.\n\nWhen we got to our tent site, it was HARD PACKED DIRT WITH ROCKS! All night I kept awake with highway traffic and stones in my back. \n\nI'll never stay here again.",
      "Family place with strict rules, if you are prepared to follow them there are no issues\nEnjoyed the location on our test trip, playground, pool, firepits, washrooms, overflow parking for the bike trailer. Would go again given the chance.",
      "Quiet,  close to town, nice sized campsites.  Not far from beach and shopping.  Would return anytime"

      "There are no sewer hook ups for long term camping, only short term which is counterintuitive. Short term campers can easily access the sewer dump on their way out. \nLong term campers have to move the camper or use a portable drain tank which is very inconvenient.\nThe facilities are old and out dated. The park grills are rusted and falling off their stands.\nThe wi-fi internet is virtually usless which sums that up. Folks who need to stay connected to business should bring a hot spot device.\nThe bathroom stalls are loose and the doors dont close properly or at all on a couple. Two stall doors are missing.\n Missing urinals, non functional sinks.

We fished from the pier and had a good time. Nice level land for walking and riding bicycles. \n\nWhat we did not like:\nMost of their sites are water and electric only and the full hook ups are on a first come first served basis so get there early.  The club house was closed while we were there and there were no planned activities. The pool and fishing pier are a long walk from the camping sites.",

      "Been coming here since i was a baby i know almost everyone and yearly it just gets better and letter i love this place no matter what people say",
      "Very disappointed with Bush Park Camping resort RV sites and management for daily or weekly campers. We stayed for ten days at this RV park in July of 2017. One of the first things I noticed within an hour of setup was the amount of flies in our RV trailer, at any given time a dozen flies could be found inside. For some reason the dumpsters for this park are set no further than 50 yards away from their RV and tent sites. This is a huge permanent camper park with over 500 permanent trailers and they have 3 to 4 large container dumps.  Even after a fully packed July 4th weekend their dumpsters did not get taken off until late into the following week. Trash overflowed for days and wreaked of decay into our RV when the wind was in our direction. Then on Tuesday July 4th most RVs were leaving and heading home while we were staying the remainder of week. At 10 am the sewer system had completely backed up from all the RVs that had dumped their blackwater tanks and was significantly overflowing from the sewer pipes into the lowest ground sites. Are brand new outside under the awning carpet was ruined with sewage, our brand new sway bar stabalizer hitch was covered in sewage and sewage had pooled to above the drain spout of our cooler that was sitting on the ground next to our door so we had toss our cooler. After they had a septic company come out and drain the sewer system I had to make the effort to contact the park to get another site to move into that hadn't been contaminated and what do they do was gave me the one directly across from it. A load of lime was supposed to be put down over the ground to neutralize the smell but it never happened, also I had to be cautious about my dogs walking away from it. Later in the early next morning flooding rains came and flooded out the camp sites which surely spread the sewage that was left uncovered on the ground. Gross. I also feel sorry to the poor campers they put back into those spots, kids running around barefoot. It was a pond of sewage there. Not one time did we hear from the park or management concerning the inconvenience and damage to our personal belongings. They were definitely aware of the severity because half their workers came to watch. By Friday July 7th my fiance went to the camp store to ask when the dump containers were going to be removed and if we could get reimbursed for the day we had to move RV sites, the lady in the store put it off onto the manager however we never received a call from her or refund into our bank account. Obviously they felt no concern for our experience.  After talking to another RV camper who said he had been there last year for July 4th and same thing happened with the sewage system then, it seems if this is a re-courring problem that you know your sewage system can't handle almost full capacity for the amount of sites you have you shouldn't book to full capacity. But if you don't care about your campers, their experiences or their property then this is what happens. I totally hold the park management responsible for doing a lazy and lousy job and for not showing any aplogy. Poorly managed and maintained RV camping sites. This place desperately needs new management. See my photos I posted of the sewer backup into our campsite, of course I had already removed our stuff in these pics hoping to save as much as possible. ",
      "I love this park there is so much to do the only thing I don't enjoy as much is that you have to be a certain  age to be on the docks but I understand for safety rules there could be some improvement live adding more options and campsite areas. There should be more fishing areas to.",
      "Well just got charge for my kids to camp with us . Not a good first impression .",
      "A great place to go fishing or swimming. You can also relax and enjoy yourself next to a fire. \nI do not give a rating of 5 stars to anyone because I believe that everyone has room for improvement improvement. So for me to give a 3 star to someone mean you are very good but has room to improve.... "

You don't see this exceptional service anymore. Very refreshing!  Especially love the area where the campers are on the inside and the tents are on the outside because it creates an opportunity to meet people and I did meet a lot of wonderful people.  Loved that. The grass is beautifully green and soft.  My Mum told me I found gold and she's right :)",
      "Beautiful and well keep grounds. Several RV sites are large, so you do not have the other campers too closed. The campground has been developed to have the RV on the inside and the tents on the outside. The campground is quiet even though it is just off Route 1.  The grass is beautifully green. Fire pit and picking table at every site. Firewood is delivered and trash is picked up to your site. Perfect for sightseeing the coast. There is a lot of low speed roads perfect from cycling between the campground (Route 1) and the beach from Portsmouth to Hampton. Just about 15 minutes by car from Hampton Beach. Unfortunately no swimming pools. Very good price quality.",

Our site#13 was plenty large enough for our 20 ft camper but we stuck out into the road while hooking up. Water ,electric and sewer hookups were fine.  We had a fire both nights and the firewood was delivered to the site. We spent most of our time sightseeing the coast.    The staff was friendly and the park was quiet both nights even though we were just off Route 1.  If we ever pass thru here again we will stay here.",

      "i would NOT recommend this campground. \nWhen we checked in the woman tried to get me to pay even though I had already mailed a check. I told her I had mailed a check and she was unsure. A business owner should not be that disorganized when it comes to money.  \"Ahh let me check and get back to you\". \nThen while she was checking us in she kept saying \"let me just talk to this person real quick\". This didn't just happen once, but twice. And there was nothing quick about the second time either. At least five minutes. \nSo then we buy wood and head to our site, which we were told we had electric. The electric on our site didn't work so she told us to share with the site next to us. Not only is that uncomfortable and an invasion of someone else's space but also inconvenient when we paid to have our own electric and packed accordingly. \nThen they deliver our wood. It is absolutely soaked. After attempting a fire to cook with for about 45 minutes we went and asked for more wood and were told \"oops the tarp blew off last night in the rain\". They brought more wood which also didn't work. Luckily a nearby seasonal sold us some of their dry stuff. The ONE pro of this campground was how friendly every single seasonal was. \nWe enjoyed the pool and our site for the evening and I thought, well maybe this place isn't that bad and it was just a rough check in, until I went to take a shower in the morning....\nThe first door I opened was full of junk and apparently not used a shower. The second door I opened led to a shower but the light had fallen and was on the floor. Finally had SOME luck with the third door. The light turned on at least.... there were bugs everywhere, mold, hair, and someone else's soap left in there that had clearly been there for a while because it was also covered in hair and bugs. I haven't felt the need to shower with shoes on since college.... \noverall we were extremely disappointed with this campground and will NOT be returning.",

      "Been camping at Crossrip for 12 years, started as a weekend camper and now seasonal.  Best part of Crossrip is you can choose to be a seasonal or a weekend camper and both are  welcomed by all.  I am a weekend camper through the “off season” but always come back to Crossrip for the spring and summer months.  We have new owners after 40+ years and they are doing a wonderful job at upgrading the camp yet leaving the feel of being on the bay quiet and serene alone.  I can promise you, if you need help of any kind there will always be someone willing to lend a hand and if you have any ideas about the camp Rebecca or Catherine are willing to listen for they are new owners and are working hard at making Cross rip a campground for all to enjoy.  Bring your pole, boat, kayak, canoe or enjoy a fire at the beach. If you like a place that is natural and the lights are the stars this is the place for you.",

      "Very clean and well managed campground with services that work perfect.  Nice view of the bay.  Be sure you check out the virtual tour that we created of this location.\nThe park WiFi is free however only works near the office.  We used our Rogers Wireless and it was acceptable.",
      "Very clean washrooms and showers. Friendly staff. Close to a convenience store and a take-out. A beautiful beach is a short walk away.\n\nWifi is only available in or near a tourist centre near the office.\n\nBig drawback - the 11 pm no noise policy is interpreted as meaning that idiots can make as much noise as they want until that time. \n\nLast night some obnoxious neighbours were playing loud music until 11. Afterwards they kept loudly braying at each other until 12:30. \n\nI'd like to recommend this place but can't until they crack down on noise.",

      "We love this campground for kids. There are activities scheduled everyday and lots of Yogi sightings. There was always something to do! We did crafts (it rained part of the time we were there), pony rides, hay ride, train ride, dance party, petting zoo, and pool. The pool, slides, and water park are great. There is a shallow/walk-in water park area that's great for kids who aren't swimmers yet. We also enjoyed the food delivery from the onsite restaurant right to our site... perfect for snacks around the campfire. The ice cream at the restaurant was good too!!\nWe stayed on a perimeter site. It was large spot and the location was wooded with plenty of shade.\nWe had no issues with the cleanliness as noted in other reviews (although we didn't use the bathhouses). All of the staff were friendly and accommodating.",
      "This place is amazing if you have kids! We've gone 3 years in a row and the staff go all out with the themes!\nOur first year was Christmas in July and even my stoic older teenagers had so much fun they put their phones down and played! \nOur second year was the chocolate theme which was also amazing \nThis year we went to the Wizard (Harry Potter) themed week and the staff again went all out. My kids had an amazing time and I thank the staffso very much for that! \nSpecial props to Andrew who was a saint with the kids. Especially the smaller ones when they would start to cry if they were tagged or their team lost.\nPros: great themes, kids will be kept active and entertained, a large variety of things to do from swimming, jumping pillows, arts and crafts and so much more.\nCons: the bathrooms and the smells.\nNow, they do clean the bathrooms and bath houses on a regular basis, but the guests at this Jellystone seem to just trash them far more than any other campground we've ever been to. Not sure why that is, but we so often see the staff do a thorough cleaning job and when we go back in 10 minutes later there is trash and toilet paper everywhere. \nAs for the smells; depending on your site location you are going to have some septic based smells. I've noticed that it seems to emanate from locations that have the large sewage manhole covers. If you are not near one, you'll never notice. If your location is on one (like near site 21) or you walk past it, the smell is unavoidable and unmistakable. \nIf you have no need of the bathrooms or bathhouses, then this is easily a 5 star location if you have kids.",
      "The staff was very polite... Some of the campers, not so much. Overall we had a great  time and met some good people. They had activities,movies,a dance. It was nice.My kids favorite  was the pool!We had to drag them out just to eat! ",
      "Spacious full hook-up RV sites, water access, beach, complimentary boat rentals--This campground has a TON to offer for any campers. But let's talk about their pools. They basically have an on site water park. I mean, I played in the pool like every day and I'm a fully grown adult. So I can only imagine how much fun families have here. Highly recommend this spot for a weekend getaway. We stayed for a full week in June and it was amazing. (And not loud and crazy, like you might expect with a family park like this.)",
      "We decided to go on a group camping trip and somehow came across this location in our online search and boy am I happy with our choice! We were a large group of 29 and rented the group tent area. Most of our group were first time campers and were pretty skeptical about how things would go. I was the person in charge of planning the trip and this campground made that job very easy for me. There were so many activities planned for the kids. The pool was great, petting zoo, pony rides and even scavenger hunts. We also had a blast on the pedal boats! The staff was so patient with our group. I could tell that us checking in to pedal boat was rough because of the size of our group but the young lady smiled and even took our group picture. This was truly a weekend that we will never forget! Everyone on the campground was so nice to us, people waved and some even stopped to talk to us! We planned on going to a different campground every year but have now decided to make this our yearly \"framily\" camping trip location. Thanks for showing us a great time!"

      "I had a wonderful summer. The owners are very vigilant in running a tight ship which makes it a very safe and fun campground. The activities are always fun. Cheryl is great with the kids and takes the time to make sure they have a good time. Bill is great with the campground and always keeps up with keeping it a nice, clean place. Arlene is what I would call a workaholic! She is always on the go and is willing to lend a hand to help someone especially the new campers. I will definitely go back next summer. So thank you pines and pines staff.",
      "Not a bad place for my first time.  Don't expect a 5 star campground though. Granted, bathroom is not great but it is still clean enough to go potty and shower. Pool is nice. The site I was at (137) is a good size site. No issues with my site neighbor. Had a good 4th of July here. Thanks.",

      "I was advised by a few people not to camp at The Pines but stubborn me didn't listen and went anyway, boy do I regret it!! The owner wants to tell adults when to go to bed and shut off the lights and fire pit and if you don't do it he calls the cops and makes up lies so that you have to leave and he gets to keep his money because he will randomly pick a violation of the agreement and says that's the reason why he's kicking you out and he gets to keep his money. Be careful everyone with this campsite it's not that great the owners are rude and not friendly and are very hungry for money!!!!!!!"

I understand their cancellation process, however since it was truly a medical emergency, I thought maybe they would reimburse us for one night. But, the owner replied that it is their policy to not reimburse for any circumstances. For this reason, I would never recommend staying at this campground.",

      "A great, clean, well run campground. I'd say about 80% of the clientele are permanent campers, gorgeous decks and gazebos built around most of them. The sites that aren't taken are still great, especially the \"I\" sites that we stay in. Large sites that allow you to camp by yourself or even pull in opposite to your neighbor and have campers facing each other (which is what we do, we camp with friends). Take advantage of their golf cart rentals, as there is only one bathhouse (and it had always been amazingly clean and stocked with TP) which is a very good walk away from most of their available sites. A vehicle will work just as good, but golf carts rule the campground there, which is great. \n\nPossibly the best part of this place is their actual clientele. They are very inviting and are very pet friendly. We have spent multiple nights here and noise has never been an issue. These folks can have a great time and keep it close to them in the same breath. \n\nTheir small beach front is absolutely amazing for small children, (1yo walkers - 5yo adults) it starts to get above chest level around 25ft out on kids who are around 30 inches tall. There's no real surf as it is in a bay, so it's perfect. \n\nIt is certainly a destination I'd recommend for anyone with pets or kids, or who are just personable people (being a camper it's hard not to be). It isn't camping in the woods by any means, but it is a perfect spot for small families and pet parents. ",
      "Beautiful location on the Chesapeake Bay. Friendly and attentive staff and friendly residents. Great experience.",
      "Great place for people who aren't high maintenance. Friendly people everywhere and each trailer has a nice sized lot. It's also not cowded; however, service from employees aren't always great and front lots only receive thirty ampsof power.",
      "Stayed 2 nights in our 35' travel trailer. Lots are not very big and it took some work to get in and out. Most lots are permanent sites. Most residents were friendly. Beach small but nice. Part of the beach is private but there aren't any signs to identify the border. My kids got fussed at by someone for being on 'their' beach. Our 30A shore power outlet was upside down, which made it difficult to plug in. Someone hammering away followed by Skilsaw sounds woke us at 7am. Dump station not conveniently located. Had to hit the dump station on the way out and there were vehicles parked close to it. I asked about the dump station when we checked in and was told if there were cars in the way they would be cleared out for checkout. When checking out there were golf carts and cars partially blocking the dump station so I went into the office to inquire and the golf carts were promptly moved, but they didn't know who the vehicles belonged to. Had to work around the vehicles which was difficult. Only dumpsters are located at the end of a road within the campground. Not convenient if you are hooked up. Great location but not our style.",

However in the future I plan to visit here & stay again. The staff are very friendly & helpful. To anyone arriving at night, just beware there is a trailer park to this business, which is separated from the RV Resort. When we arrived at night, after office closed, we unintentionally turned into the trailer park. Only way out was to turn around, & having a car towing dolly, we could not back up & therefore had to disconnect the small car & then turn around.",

They also make pizza, wings and breadsticks to order.  The office/store are open until 9 p.m. making it convenient for later check-in.",

We stayed in our camper this time but, we have stayed in the trolley cabin before which was another exciting visit. We are planning on our next trip there right now. Thanks for a great park. ",

      "I came there meaning to stay a week...I stayed for a month!  It was the best summer I spent with my kids!. Horseshoe lake is CAMPING, so if your looking for any real amenities there aren't any. There are restroom facilities including a shower and a place to wash your clothes (if you need it) but that's it. \nThe people were wonderful, the lake was a stones throw away, the kids took horseback riding leassons, and we all made new friends. We have plans to return again this year...I can't wait!\nIn conclusion, if you're looking for a quiet retreat to \"get away from it all\", if you enjoy camping (tent or Rv)....enjoy a quiet lake, good wholesome people, you'll love it here! You should come on out! : D",

Friendly staff and very \"rustic.\"  Only thing we didn't like was the bathhouse.  Could be nicer and cleaner and needs repairs but if you have your own shower/bathroom not an issue.",
      "The owner Darlene tells you one thing and does another. She yells at people and the ones that are extended stay are treated poorly. She changes the rules from week to week and text them to you, accuses people for other people's trash and pet droppings. It's is not managed well at all. Yeah it might get good ratings from weekend or night campers but she ( Darlene) needs to learn how to talk to adults especially when she has not bee shown  any disrespect form the extended stay campers. The place is a little dated and could use some upgrades. Will be out of this place as soon as the opening comes available at others extended camp sites . ",

That being said, staff was so friendly. Firewood was a super reasonable price. Tent camping was $20 for a site. If you can make it to Fort Nelson on your tank of gas, do it. It's way cheaper there.\n\nOverall, fine place, just expensive for what it is.\n\nThe goat is friendly. Make sure you pet it.",

Hosts were lovely, the whole property and campsite were amazingly well maintained and a joy to stay in. The washhouse was just great to use and kept very clean and was very well appointed.

      "Maranatha, a wasted opportunity! The one good thing here: the landscape! Really beautiful with the lagoon/river on the one side, ocean on the other. Well, If there wasnt heaps of waste lying everywhere. It reminds you more of a waste dump than a beach front. Upon arrival, toilets smeared with feces await you. The hut's beds also are dirty, but the \"staff\"(bunch of adolescents) doesnt seem to care, rather playing video games. Restaurant has a big menu of which approx. 95% is not available and takes hours to be prepared. All of that at big prices. No flowing water, no power wouldnt be a problem if it wasnt for 40cedi/pers/night. Hype is totally unjustified. Place is totallY run down. Never again!",

Get up for the sunrise and walk over to the east side to see it if you don't get a site nearby. Good prices for water and power and they even give you free firewood!!",
      "Picture perfect, peaceful setting with sweeping vistas over the river valley.  Mature trees with unconventional ( non side by side) low density layout makes for a very relaxing setting.  The central showers and washrooms are new and very well maintained.  The playground emulates an old fort with turrets, towers, a small suspension bridge and real live teeter totters.  Great place for a getaway or a one night stopover.",

      "I thoroughly enjoyed my 3 days at Blue Cedars RV Park & Campground. The thing that most impressed me was the women’s washroom! Clean. Clean. A long bank of sinks, one even lower than the rest to accommodation our youngsters. An adequate number of plug-ins, a bright environment, and hot showers were all part of the “plus”. Bonus; showers are included in the campsite fee. The outdoor pool was another bonus. I felt there was ample room at the individual campsites for folks like me not requiring hooks-up. The non-full services sites are adequate in size, close to a water tap, and have a table. The owner has placed a porta-pottie at a convenient location, away from the full-amenities washroom, allowing guests a shorter walk. I felt welcomed at this Park. There are trees, there is grass. When thanking the owner for a great time and commending him on a lovely campsite I was quite surprised when he mentioned some had complained. For what, I wondered? Because some have complained, I wanted to speak of my positive experience.",
      "This seemed like a place operating for maximum profit with the bare amenities and maintenance needed to get by.  I had to walk a long way to the dumpster to throw something away.  Garbage cans would be very helpful.  It sounded like we were camping next to a freeway, which meant not much sleep since we were tent camping.  Bad experience.",
      "I have no idea where all these folks who wrote good reviews stayed, but it wasn't here! Old guy in office is just plain rude.  Locks and unlocks office door when he doesn't want to be bothered. Place is filthy with debris, garbage in fire rings, dog poop, and our site had old patio mat that looks like it's been there for years. Wouldn't even let the dog walk on it. Pool is closed, looks like it hasn't been used in years and area is full of old tires and garbage.  Bathrooms looks like they may have been redone at some point, but they are moldy and smell now.  Wifi is a joke. Old guy probably turns that off and on as well.  Too many other campgrounds in area to stay here. ",
      "Hidden gem. Beautiful stalls, quiet. Showers on site. They even have quaint little cabins you can rent.",
      "We stayed as evacuees from Williams Lake for over a month. We have zero complaints. I'm shocked that so many people have so many complaints but I suppose most people will jump on the internet to complain at their easiest opportunity. Morley (the manager) and Christine were fantastic to our family and many others during the evacuation. They went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and looked after. There was a broken board at the play ground, we mentioned it to them and it was fixed immediately. Yes there is some noise from the highway however you are staying close to town, that is part of camping close to town with Costco and other stores 5 minutes away!......this campground takes pets, they have no restrictions, the showers are not coin operated, therefore FREE. There is WiFI, it's great when the entire campground isn't full and using it but you can't fault the campground for what you think is poor internet as that will happen anywhere you have a large number of people using at once.  I witnessed the campground manager having to clean up garbage from sites where people were just irresponsible about leaving garbage out or leaving garbage behind when they check out. I witnessed him dealing with people on a few occasions over the course of our time there, I never once thought he was unpleasant. He is just to the point and honest, which I appreciate and some people just can't handle! My family will stay here again and this will be our preferred place to camp when we visit PG."

It is not part of his \"job\" to haul firewood, but he did, and at least 5 truck loads! So thank you Mr. Park Supervisor!",

      "We were excited to stay here for two nights in August but had to cancel due to unforeseen circumstances. I looked at the cancellation policy and saw that we would be paying a $25 cancellation fee but would get the rest back as we gave over a week's notice to cancel. I contacted the resort and received $6.50 back for one night minus the cancellation fee. I am still waiting for the full refund for the second night and the resort will not return any of my communications. I was excited about the place and was going to try again next year when we could reschedule our trip, but this will not be happening now. I had read the fine print and know about the cancellation fee, but the lack of communication about the refund for the second night is unacceptable. It's been over three weeks now. It's only $35, you'd think they'd just process the refund as we gave sufficient notice...",
      "Nice spot along the lake. Campsites had very little privacy. Lots of junk laying around which gave it a poor vibe. Aside from the new playground the park felt run down and rough. It's unfortunate as the area has potential. 50 plus for a night this was our most expensive stay and the worst park we have visited on our journey. Nice staff park needs to be upkept.",
      "Small campsite with limited (but clean!) facilities. Next to Williamson Lake, which is also open to people who are not staying on the campsite.\n\nWiFi range is limited to around 30 feet around the office, so you're out of luck if you get a spot towards the end of the site.\n\nDo bring your mosquito repellent, quiet waters will attract a lot of these pests during the warm season!",
      "Recommended to us by the locals. Beautiful lake. Great park for the kids to play. Can also rent tubes and canoes for a paddle around the lake. ",
      "Family friendly but there is not much privacy or space between sites. Quite and relaxing. Service is great"

      "It's a decent campground. The view is nice . It was very quiet. There are some full time trailers but you don't really notice them. It is 10 minutes from Town. We didn't talk to a single employee. Booked on line . There was a clip board out side the office with our site number on it, and no need to check in when leaving. The privacy between sites is zero, but they are kinda staggered so you get a little off set. We did not use the shower house's or washrooms .",
      "After reading the reviews, I feel lucky that I had a fantastic experience at Whistler RV. I went tent camping with my husband, my 5 year-old girl and an 8 month-old boy. We also noted that we had a large tent when booking in addition to having child and infant. The campground placed us with a large pad, beautiful tall trees at the background, and pretty close to the bathroom.  Can't ask for a better site for our family.  Customer service, they responded to my email query about fire ban and propane fire pit within couple hours and were courteous.",
      "Never stayed and never will even think about it again. I cancelled 8 days prior to arrival due to forest fires and the road in from our arrival destination was closed. They refused to refund me my money. I would have been better off cancelling the day prior. I would have gotten some sort of refund then. I was trying to be courteous so they could book out our site sooner...They are crooks as far as I'm concerned. I'm sure we were not the only people that cancelled and they were trying to save their profits for the season because of all the fires.",
      "The brochure and website for this park says 'free shuttle to village' and 'free wifi'. When we arrived we were told that the shuttle had not operated for 2 years, and that there was an $11 a day charge for wifi. When we told the girl on the front desk, she said that 'one of our companies hasn't updated it yet'. It's been 2 years... Also, all of the brochures in the Whistler Village Tourist information center (which had clearly been refilled recently) also made those claims. It was simply false advertising. Also, this park is no where near Whistler village. It was a good 10-15 minute drive which meant you also needed to pay the $30 a day RV parking charge at Whistler.",
      "While it is kind of like sardines in a can without much division between sites, the site was level with an amazing view.\nPeople were extremely quiet. No disruption of other people.\nWiFi is an extra fee. It is very hard to get in touch with an employee, by phone, or at the desk."

      "The owners are super nice. However, on top on paying what I considered top dollar, they also charge for the showers. Although only $1 for 5 minutes, I asked them why. They said because people would leave the water running. I thought well then just put on shut off valves. Don't charge people. But then they explained that everyone is starting to charge for water and I thought in 5,000 miles, this was the first place to charge for showers. It just comes across as really cheap and I, personally, don't like cheap people. Other than that it was a nice place.",

      "We had a very bad bear experience tent camping here.  After spending several days wilderness camping to peace and quiet in Glacier we got a campsite here for the last night of the season (we were the only tent campers).  They didn't warn us about bear precautions at all, but we ran into a local RV camper who said there had been a grizzly around on a fairly regular basis.  Though we kept all food separate from our tent area, we were woken up at midnight to 2 very agitated grizzly bears in our campground who had most likely been accustomed to feeding off of scraps in the area, and had to leave and spend the night in our car.  On top of all of this, the tent-sites were mostly littered with cow patties.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily dissuade someone with an RV from staying here (it looks like that makes up most of their customers anyways) but they should get rid of the tent-sites if they are not willing to maintain them and take the necessary bear precautions.",
      "This is a lovely, small Campground in the Glacier National Park. They have wonderful hiking trails, outstanding drives, and a pretty good restaurant as well. We were permitted to park our trailer near where the tent campers area was, and leave it while we went for a drive for the day. They even watched the trailer for us and did not charge us. In the morning I hiked my dog not too far away to where the horseback riding was available. I did not enter the horseback riding area. A large, territorial dog rushed out of the horse area toward my dog but was called back by a woman who came out of her trailer. It appeared she was the person in charge of the horseback riding. I said good morning and she did not respond to me, rather just glared at me. Well I'm sure the pup was just doing its job, I would never ride a horse there, due to her discourtesy. I prefer to spend my money where I am made to feel welcome. Yes, my dog was on a leash. No, her dog was not on a leash. We did meet two very friendly Park employees who had a trailer parked next to ours. They were so happy to recommend great drives and things to do in the park for us. They had an awesome dog named Marley who was an absolute angel. I would definitely revisit Glacier National Park and I would definitely stay in the park again. ",
      "We stayed in the dry camping area in our 25' motor home because there were no sites with hookups available.  I'm so glad there weren't!  The dry camping part of this campground felt like a state park.  There were trees and grass.  The sites were spacious with fire rings and picnic tables.  There were ample faucets to obtain water very close to our site. It wasn't noisy or crowded.  We loved it here and wished we had been able to  stay longer.",
      "The place is pretty dated in every respect. It's  in an area with  little to do other than drive through the GNP or hike. They had musical slots going on and we lost a whole day waiting for our new slot to become available. Very inconvenient  and a lot of trouble.We wanted to leave a day early and asked  for  refund on one night 48 hours in advance. But they absolutely do not let go o f your money under any circumstances. Would stay on the West side of Glacier  Park if had it to do over again. The only thing good here is a nice view.",
      "Restaurant too expensive..can't share the huge portions or they charge you for 2. Family style portion is 20 bucks and seniors can't eat that much. Only option is a sandwich or burger."

Beautiful sites, and many available during non-holiday periods (even the weekends don't fill this campground up). It's $20 per night, first come = first served. Very simple to fill in the form and make the payment anytime day or night. Check or cash works easily!",

If not for all the notes... Otherwise I would give this place 5 🌟 would most definitely I would give 5 🌟 when John is camp host... Thanks and Happy camping!!!",

      "This place was pitiful!!  The bathrooms were dirty and 3 of the 4 showers (two men's and 2 women's for the whole campground??) did not work. The fourth shower leaked so much the buildup of iron on the floor was totally unappealing.  And, you had to pay $5 for each shower!  Insects in the sink made brushing your teeth or washing your face a major challenge. The campground itself was mostly barren and open with no shade but lots of dust. Trash was all over!  There were a few okay tent camp sites but most were either too small or in the open. I had a paper that said the cost was $20 a night but they charged us $25, and there was no store or food available. Do not go here.",
      "As many people stated this is a beautiful campground. The woman checking us in was very friendly even though it was evening when we arrived. The RV and tent campground is down the paved road near the lake. The check-in office, nearby road and teepees are not visible from the campground. We had 50amp electric, water and sewer for $50 a night (no tax as this is on the Reservation). The ground, although a field and the very rainy weather when we were there) was very solid for our 35' RV and spacious. We had a view of the beautiful mountains. We had great Verizon service and no T-Mobile service. We enjoyed our stay!",
      "Great place to stay if Glacier is full. Friendly staff and nice enough sites with electric hookups. Save your money on showers, however, they are not the nicest and have no hot water.",
      "Excellent for tent camping. Get site g15 thru g21. Lake front with your private path to waterfront. Sunsets are awesome.",
      "The staff was great and there's a lot of campsites to pick from. It does get really windy out here, and not much shade. If you don't take a shower by 5 p.m. expect freezing cold water. They say that the showers can have hot water enough for six different showers but it seems to be off by the time then the sun sets. The bathroom only has three showers. The center shower tends to be a shower for kids. The shower head is very low and there a very fim light to help.\nWhere we camped we ended up having a private beach. We had three fire pits to pick from and plenty of parking in the center. The staff was very helpful and accommodating for all of our questions. The washer and dryer were out of service at the time. One of the cheaper sites though! Very close to the park entrance and ten minutes down the road from general store and gas. (Sinclair,  also one of the cheaper had stations- credit card only!))\nI had verizon service.  Nothing for tmobil or sprint."

Placed our food on the  table and our apples rolled off due to the slope .my wife was cooking on the cooker and the food is rolling to one side of the pan due to the slope of the caravan. We went bed and in the night we had heavy rain as this caravan is under the trees we had branches bashing off it and scrapping it all night .as if the rain wasn't bad enough but mixed in with the branches and bits falling out of the trees sleep was a none starter. The curtains in the bedroom didn't meet so we had to put a blanket upto give us our privacy. The pull out bed in the lounge doesn't support the weight of a 9 and 10 year old so it was unusable and or 2 boys slept on the seats. It's Monday night and we don't leave until Saturday morning so I may be adding to this post over the next few days. ",

      "We stayed the last week of September 2017. I've never stayed in a more beautiful camp, especially for the money. It is well manicured while still felling natural. If the Smurfs ever manage a campground, this is it, magical!  Radium hot springs pool & spa is only ten minutes away.  It's great for recharging & relaxing after a long day trip as it's open some seasons until 11 pm!\n\nCanyon RV Resort is the perfect launching point for day trips to the more expensive to stay at Banff & Chateau Lake Louise areas. Plus you get the gorgeous 90 plus minute drive. The exact drive time will vary depending on how much your crew stops to explore!  There are a dozen places to stop along the way to look out or hike along the emerald green Bow river on the way north to Lake Louise.",
      "Treated badly by owner, because we had reserved and then asked if they would have a site available by the creek when we arrived, even though we hadn't requested it in our reservation request. We were put in site#3 which was barely long enough for our fifth wheel and although we had stated in our request that we had slides the site wasn't wide enough. Because the owner felt that my husband \"embarrassed her ' in the office by asking, she stomps down to the inferior site to continue the argument. When I asked her where we should park the truck she said on the grass, even tho right on the rules it says not even to put a mat on the grass and park on the patio so our slide would fit. We were ready to  unhook and she evicted us! We had accepted the site but she needed to be right and win! She said she had told us on our confirmation that it twas site three, well it's hard to tell what the site is truly like until you get there! Make sure you ask for EVERYTHING you want when you reserve so you don't upset the owner!  UNBELIEVABLE !!! hissy fit! Seen her upset before with  another patron and was crying and complaining to me outside my truck window because he yelled at her, which was unprofessional, to involve me because her feelings were hurt.",
      "Let's get this out of the way first... Yes, the toilets and showers are clean. In fact they sparkle. Day or night they were always clean and fresh.\n\nWe visited the Canyon RV Resort near the end of July 2017 at the end of our trip across western Canada.\n\nThe resort is a beautiful place to have a relaxing break.  The tin lids will love it. A beautiful shallow stream runs through the middle of park creating a dream playground for the adventurous ones.  For those less adventurous it is a wounderful setting for an evening stroll, crossing back and forth over the babbling brook as you work your way from one end of the park to the other.\n\nThe sites are generously sized. Many back right on to the stream creating a very relaxed and pleasant atmosphere.  We stayed in \"Site #0\" - a perfect sized spot for our little RV.  Having stayed at the park, a site next to the stream will be our choice next time.\n\nThe park is lovingly maintained and is always clean. Not once did we spot a single piece of litter. There were lots of dogs in the park, however they are always on a lead and I don't recall hearing a single bark.\n\nCheck out the photos - they don't lie.  This is a beautiful resort with great managers and an obviously devoted and caring team.\n\nBrian J & Sherry T\nSydney, Australia",
      "Delightful site, good showers, laundry, very helpful staff. Trees and pretty planting, hard roads, no dust.\nBrook running through site disguises any noise there may be from road.\nWish we could clone it and install other places.\nBest site on our Canada trip so far.\nPity it was raining!!!",
      "Awesome park! Well kept, beautiful area. Friendly staff. Stayed 5 days and will be back. One of our favourite campsites."

      "This site is located in a beautiful spot and the owner is one of the nicest most helpful people you'll ever meet but the site itself seems to be having a bit of an identity crisis. Its a run down disused golf course that doubles up as a sheep farm and a field to pitch a tent. There are two to three spots for tents that want power.  The building itself also lacks any defined spaces with the toilet, shower, owners washing machine, gym equipment, buddhist centre and storage all sharing the space.There is no utility sink for dishes at all and one shared rather tired male/female bathroom with no hot water. The shower room has the owners washing machine and  three shower cubicles ( none have hot water) but one has a partially functioning electric shower. Which after much fussing about with it will just about get luke warm. There is nowhere to change and as its a shared space with two half swinging doors and the washing machine, no privacy. The light also doesnt work so its daytime showering only.\nIt has so much potential , its affordable, quiet and great for a campfire. It would definitely be one of my favourite sites if the facilities were improved upon and cleaned.",

      "I would have easily give this place a four or five star review but was extremely annoyed they didn't inform coming campers that there are a group of close to 50 motorcycle riders camping that night without having any restriction on hours of their operation. The bikers were in and out till quite late and started running their engine from 7am for close to a couple of hours disturbing the entire non-biker campers. \nPity as it had so much potential with its natural backdrop of mountain ranges around but the only thing I could appreciate that night was they allow to make an open fire. \nThe price was higher than other camp sites as well.

There were quite a few places to pitch but most seemed either very stony or boggy. The latter was to be expected due to the weather but the stones  make it difficult to drive pegs in.

Campground owner is extremely nice and accommodating, he let us stay in his field across the street from the campground because we had a large trailer and wouldn't fit in any of the sites.

      "Got to Lone Fir ahead of my group to grab a first come, first serve site. After fully paying for the site for 4 days x $17 = $68, putting the tag up and go out to see WA pass for the afternoon, I came back to someone backing in an RV because the Ranger had come by and pulled the ticket. I followed all the rules, fully paid, but pulled site tab anyway. I haven't gotten any response from the Ranger station, left multiple voicemails, but no one seems to care. \nAnd there is no running water, no camp host and the bathroom ran out of TP. This is the worst experience I've ever had at a NF campground and I routinely camp & climb year round. And all of this over 4th July weekend, the busiest of all.",
      "28 yr Active Duty military, family camper, and world traveler here...Please Do NOT spend your money here.  It's not possible to fully explain my disappointment with the facilities and the owner.  I reviewed other customer reviews before submitting this, and I see a trend with ownership (Jeremy's) attitude towards his customers.  \n    I've never been to a campground that felt so much like a prison camp.  If you have a family with kids or dogs then be prepared for the owner, Jeremy, to loiter around your site and issue you a stern threat of \"kicking you out without a refund\" if there is any noise made after 10pm.  He is intolerant of any noise he can hear.  We found him standing in the dark near our site multiple times trying to eavesdrop...pretty creepy.\n    The RV sites are packed together with fire pits in the strangest locations.  This results in your campfire being behind your back bumper and often 5-10 ft away from your neighbors fire or camper.  There is only one restroom for the entire park, there aren't enough toilets/showers...and it was disgusting every time.   The campground is right next to the highway and you will be forced to hear/watch logging trucks and 4x4s blast by at high speed all night.  The \"free\" wireless is worthless and if you're there when it rains...expect 1-4 inch deep standing water throughout your site.  \n     We had 5 RV's leave the campground early and we refuse to return.  The night before we left I tried giving Jeremy honest helpful feedback...my tone was friendly and calm, but Jeremy became irate and began yelling.  He refused to listen and responded like a petulant child instead of a grown adult.  After he knew we were leaving he then said we were kicked out for being noisy, but admitted that nobody had complained of noise once.  He even went as far as insulting my military service.  Truly disappointed."

      "Nicest RV Park in Fairbanks.  Stayed 6 weeks, close to town and convenient to Fred Meyer shopping.  RV Park is part of the larger complex of cottages and restaurant.  The Restaurant/Bar on site is Chena Alaska Grill.  Food is a little pricey but really good.  They have a nice deck for dining as well.  Easy walk to Pikes Landing Restaurant for less expensive food.  Pikes also has a deck on the River.  The Princess Lodge is 1/2 way between the RV Park and Pikes, they have a restaurant and bar as well.  WIFI was excellent.  Cable was horrible, couldn't watch it at our site because it was so fuzzy.  Owners need to clear out or cut up and back the trees on the sites as well as get rid of the sticker bushes that are along some sites.  Seems like the owners also need to capitalize on the riverbank and build it up so guest have a comfortable place to sit and watch the river go buy.   We paid $52 a night in July and August.  Manager is very friendly and helpful.  Would stay again.",

      "Friendly reception, clean bathrooms. Facilities could be better layed out. Cramped campers kitchen.",
      "Lovely campsite location near to Smerwick Harbour and beach. Facilities are a little basic but they work ok. 1 euro for shower. Fab views of the three sisters range beyond sea. Level pitches with pretty hedgerows.",
      "this is a lovely campsite the owners are friendly and helpfull, the pitches for tents are set in bays for 4 or 5 tents and l loved the plants and flowers, the facilities are spotless"

      "This campsite is a hidden gem and for once ideal for tents rather than just catering for motorhomes or large caravans although there are caravans on the site. We camped recently for 6 nights literally on the loch shore. Superb views. Fire pits are allowed. The facilities are small but neither my wife or I ever queued for a shower or toilet. They were regularly cleaned. The owner Catherine was very helpful and froze our freeze packs on a daily basis. The drinking water was brownish but was perfectly ok to drink. Read other reviews re tents being blown away but luckily we had 6 still nights. Other sites in the area appear to be just enormous caravan parks. Superb but don't go to the local \"pub\" Loch Tummel Inn....exorbitant prices.",
      "This is a lovely rustic site. It's right on the loch side. BBQ's & dogs welcome. We have been here several times and would definitely come back. The rope swing over the water an added bonus!",

It's not for everyone, but if you want a small site with adequate facilities in a beautiful wild location. \nWe had a family of four kids and two adults...... kids ranges from 16 to 6.

      "Flemings White Bridge Caravan & Camping is a 4 star holiday park right next to the picturesque river and a short car ride from Killarney town & its many surrounding attractions. The park has a mixture of spacious hard standing and grass pitches to suit every individual. The bathrooms showers and campers kitchen are spotlessly clean and fully equipped with a great indoor dinning sitting area. Mobile homes are also available to hire.  A wonderful welcome from the owners and a comfortable relaxed stay... Thank you Mr & Mrs Fleming. tonyfrancisrees Google Maps Local Guide.",
      "Absolutely amazing facility! We arrived very late on a friday evening - around 10:30pm, the reception was closed but there was a sign directing us to the house. The owner of the facility came out and signed us in, only for us to realize we didn't have enough cash on us, so he let us pay in the morning on our way out. He was so helpful with things to do and see in the area. We felt awful for arriving so late, but he so cheerful and helpful. The facilities were very clean and well taken care of, and the property is right near the river so if you're sleeping in a tent like us, the sound of the river helps you fall asleep. 10/10 would visit again!",
      "Great location- right on the edge of Killarney and the national park. I don't think I've ever been to a campsite so clean and well-maintained. The owners are friendly and clearly take pride in what they do which makes for a very pleasant experience!",
      "This is my favourite park in all of Ireland.  Its in a beautiful setting beside the river. Spotless. Excellent facilities.  3 blocks of toilets and showers with great flow of water.  Family run. Extremely helpful and friendly. Family very talented and regularly play irish music and also sing and dance for the tourists ",

      "We booked a tent pitch for two online, as we wanted to extend our trip around the Highlands for a couple more days. We were greeted by a friendly lady at reception, who showed us around and had a good knowledge of the local area. They have a communal fire-pit area which we used one evening, a cute little on-site shop, and great access to the forest track at the back of the campsite for views over the loch. The campsite was beautifully clean, the showers were amazing, very spacious shower-rooms, plenty of hot water, and they are even provided with hairdryers. We loved our time here and will be recommending this site to others.",
      "This is a lovely little campsite about 4 miles north of Fort Augustus. The owners are very friendly and helpful. The facilities are superb. The only  issues were the site was waterlogged (it had rained a lot but other sites were ok) midges...lots of, very little level ground for a larger tent, and we got charged £20 when tourist info indicated £7 each. Even the website states prices from £8 and we arrived on a wet September day, hardly peak season.  The owner would not budge on price. Also you have to wheelbarrow your goods to/from the pitch which was hard work on the sodden ground. All the same enjoyed our stay and probably a better experience in drier weather.",
      "Camping near the Great Glenn Way (low route). We camped here with 3 people in a tent. \nThere were a lot of midges, uncomfortably many. There wasn't even anything to repel them provided by the camp site holder. The \"drinking water\" was very unclear and tasted weird. We all got some problems after drinking it.... The ground wasn't flat. There wasn't anything to shelter from the rain. The hot water of the showers was empty in no time. (we were the only 3 on the camping). If you want to use the fire pit, you may only use wood bought from the camping. Overall the price was very expensive for what you get.",
      "I did the west highland and the great glen way with tent. This was the nicest camp site of all. Very nice people. Beautiful hidden spot. Little shop. Perfectly clean facilities. Go there!",

      "Brilliant location on the Loch Ness shore. Certainly need a car although there is a bus service between Fort Augustus and Inverness. Good low carbon footprint facilities. Piping hot showers. The main amenity block is kept spotlessly clean. Site is good for caravans, motorbikes and simple tents alike. On site Airstream caravan diner serves breakfasts and evening meals. Boat hire facility as well as friendly and helpful staff with a little but very well stocked shop. Overall an excellent site with easy access to the shores of Loch Ness.",
      "Excellent site, friendly staff and really good (nobody can even mutter territory) shower and toilet facilities. Seems strange to rate a place on its amenities but they are not far off something you would find in a decent gym. We even got an unofficial invite to the wedding reception due to occur during our stay (the couple are close with the owners not a random booking) as they would be taking up most of the site with wedding guests etc. as well as a great looking marques set up by the reception because they didn't want to spoil our trip! Lots of praise only small bit's to make it 5*",
      "I came here with a group of friends on a charity challenge of kayaking the Caledonian canal for Diabetes UK and the British Heart Foundation. I was absolutely delighted with my stay here at this beautifully picturesque campsite. The staff were so pleasant and the service I received from them was second to none. The facilities were the best I've ever seen in terms of cleanliness, convenience, lighting and luxury. Our team were on such a euphoric high and feeling pleased with ourselves during my time here having conquered the great Loch Ness in a kayak, I have to return here! I just can't wait to come back and sample this beautiful place once again.",

Showers and toilets are functional.\nStaff is friendly and showed is around. Fair price with 10€ p. P.\nCar is allowed on the green, car-doors get slammed from time to time. No late arrival area and no gate. Just a few minutes to Kenmare for Restaurant or Supermarket.",
      "Fantastic campsite, lovely big green area for tents. We were allowed to bring the car right down beside the tent as well which was so much easier than lugging all our gear across the site. Reasonable price, €20 for the two of us in a car, sleeping in a tent, for one night. Bathrooms and showers are a short trek away from where we camped for the night, but that was more our own fault for choosing where to pitch for the night than anything. Nice little kitchen / indoor seating area for making food or just hanging out in when the weather is bad.",
      "Great owners, and not expensive (25 € per night for 2 adults 2 children). Lots of place, lots of games for children, public room to play games, and even a public piano. I recommend! It only miss a washing machine, but there is one in the Kenmare Tesco (expensive : 10 € for wash+dry) ",

      "A lot of money has been spent on this site recently with excellent hard standing for caravans and campers. Each hard standing has a water supply and hook up. The facilities are in prefabricated type buildings, but are nice. Showers, although modern and spacious had such poor pressure you had to stand against the wall to get wet. Clean facilities and a well located site. Large field for tents too so I could imagine in high season that their facilities may be hard pressed to keep up with demand. Expensive at £25 per night for 2 people, but there is little other choice locally.",
      "We just needed a tent spot and they wanted £40. We started to leave because that was just too much for us and they cut us a deal, so we stayed. There are 2 showers each in the men's and women's bathrooms and you need a code to get in. The showers cost 50p for about 8 minutes, but we lost £1.50 on the women's side before we could get one to work. (we were reimbursed) The tent area was fine but they had mowed that afternoon and everything we owned was then covered in grass clippings. On the brighter side we were only  20 minutes from the cute town of Kinross with a bunch of restaurants and a coop.",
      "I would love to give this campsite 4 stars. The location is fantastic, the service was great and they have free WiFi. What lets this place down is the lack of facilities. Only 3 showers, no communal room to get out of the rain and limited washing facilities. Don't even attempt to wash your clothes as there are only a few machines. Considering how busy the place was, I believe this campsite has overextended without the appropriate infrastructure.It is one of the more expensive places to pitch a tent.\n",

      "This was a truly lovely camping experience.  Only seven pods in all, family friendly and the facilities all clean and fresh and only built four years ago! \nSituated at the top of a hill, it had beautiful views both day and night of the rolling Cork hills and was a walkers paradise. The owners could not do enough for you. \nPlus there are animals nearby to keep the children entertained along with a small playground and a brick built fire for evening getogethers.  Truly a lovely place that I intend to return to!!",

It's the worst we've ever experienced in a campsite!\n The power outlet is at the front of the stall?.....you will need an extra cord to reach it, at least it was that way for our stall. The person working though, was great and got us a cord to reach the outlet. We tried to book elsewhere while we were there but of course, every place was booked on late notice. Don't stay in the North stalls, the road ways in front of the stalls are gravel, very dusty, no one slows down. The other road ways are paved!",

      "Absolutely amazing camp ground! The owners are so friendly and really want your stay to be the best. We were sad we could only stay 1 night!! Definitely bring a swimsuit; there is a river right across the road that I imagine during the hotter months of the summer would have been fun to swim in. The horse onsite is very friendly! They have DVDs to rent, homemade baked goods and ice cream, 18 acres of land to explore, and all the fun amenities of the Armadillas. We will be back!!! ",
      "Loch Ness Glamping was one of our favorite stays while visiting Scotland! Our family of 7 adults stayed in the stables (3 adults), armadilla max (2), and armadilla (2). Each pod was close enough we could walk and visit, but far enough away for privacy. We LOVED the indoor BBQ huts, they were perfect for grilling, hanging out, and having a few drinks. There is a co-op within a few minutes drive. And tours of Loch Ness were easy to find. We only wished we had stayed more than 2 nights. Would definitely book again and recommend to any family or friends.",

      "Had really high expectations from the place but it was just okay! We stayed at the stables and even used the hottub. There was a lot of noise from the other armadilas. Guess Sonia should hire more stay for such a nice property otherwise."

      "Nice location, and caravan we hired was fine, site is small and need to book to go swimming as pool is small. Play area is fine, and prices on site ok. Don't expect a full on family holiday here, we didn't so weren't disappointed. Great location for exploring the cairngorms.",
      "Great holiday park. Everyone is helpful and friendly and the accommodation is clean and we'll looked after",
      "The setting is lovely. Cabins are spacious though quite a few things needed fixed in ours including the washing machine and the freezer. Our decking was under trees so quite a lot of debris and bird poop on the furniture but not all cabins are like this.\nOur mattress was pretty bad, neither of us slept well.\nThe pool was closed for part of one day and then part of the next after someone was caught short.\nGenerally a decent place and space for kids to run about. \n",
      "The caravans are comfortable and warm. The park is pretty quiet, considering how big and busy it is. The staff are all fabulous and dealt with any (minor) issues very quickly. The only thing I'd mark them down for (and the reason it's 4 stars and not 5) is the swimming area. Honestly, the sessions are *so* busy, the pool is really crowded. And trying to get showered and changed afterwards is something of a nightmare with small children, as again the area is really crowded. I'd quite happily recommend the kids activity sessions, and the play park. But I'd give the swimming a miss. "

Stewart and I booked online for one night initially but quickly asked for another night after we learnt that there was FREE fishing in the river at the bottom of the campsite. The campsite was very clean, the showers were piping hot and powerful and best of all FREE. There is a drying room which we used to hang our towels after our refreshing shower. The towels were lovely and dry for the next day. The campsite itself is so peaceful and the views are breathtaking. \nNow to talk about the hosts Tricia and David and their sons...absolutely amazing. Truly the nicest people you could ever wish to meet. From the first greeting at reception to our sad farewell we were made to feel that we were really special. Tricia has a real knack of making guests feel they are the best guests in the world. \nWe arrived in our hired campervan which unfortunately broke down. David very kindly looked at it for us even though he was unable to get it going. He spent ages trying his best even though he had other jobs he needed to do. After spending most of the day in the van waiting for the recovery van to arrive not only did Tricia offer to call us a taxi to get us to the hotel but she poured Stewart a beer and I had a white wine. Best hosts ever!!",

The campsite was very well equipped, with boxes of spare utensils, potted herb plants dotted around for us to use. Facilities were nice and clean. The pod itself was spacious and warm. ",

      "Really great atmosphere - met lots of other walkers and backpackers, gave the place a great feel. Staff were all really helpful and nice. €10p/p for camping (which in my opinion is the cheaper end of standard prices in Ireland), €18 for a dorm bed and €24p/p for a private room. All these prices are high season too. Great sized kitchen/common room with a lovely rustic feel. 5-10minutes walk from the centre of Dingle. Would recommend to others :) ",
      "Great hostel, very clean and friendly with plenty of space inside and out. Kitchen and living area is large and there's a big BBQ out the back. Good spaces for camping too",

He found us a pitch and it was a lovely spot with hook up! 😊 The toilets were spotless and lovely showers with nice hot water. There is a shop on site too with every spare part you might need for your caravan/motorhome. There is also some food too. Really recommend this place and cheaper than Glen Nevis! Woŕth the 5 min drive. Thanks for a lovely stop over. 😀",
      "Really nice place. Didn't plan on being in Ft. William for the night but got injured climbing down Ben Nevis so we couldn't drive back to our hotel in Glasgow. They were able to get us a booking last minute and the facilities were decent and conveniently located. I would stay there again if given the option.",
      "Brilliant camp site. Staff were extremely helpful and accomodating. The ground was in good condition despite heavy rain, better than other local sites. Facilities were good and the setting, beside a river, was peaceful. Well worth the money.",
      "Spent four nights in a Woodbury lodge and cannot recommend this site highly enough.  The lodge was clean and had everything we needed, the site was quiet with plenty of parking nearby and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. \nWould certainly go back.",
      "A large park with a nice river at the bottom. Plenty of space for tents, campers and motorhomes and static caravans available as well. Shower and toilet block is clean. Dogs are welcome so long as they're on a lead. Staff are very friendly and the warden ensures there's no nonsense. Quite far to walk to town and aside from a nearby supermarket there's not much in the immediate vicinity but as a base to drive to attractions its good."

Hence, try avoiding spots which gets very wet, in case your tent can't handle it or that you just don't want to get your shoes wet when entering or leaving your tent...\n\nReasonable prices. \nMake sure to pre-book since it's a popular place (if just staying in a tent you might not need to book in advance). \n\nIn summary - highly recommended!",
      "Fantastic camp ground with the cleanest facilities and enough to never que. I see someone cleaning all the time! Great views when it's not raining and about 10 min walk to begin your Ben Nevis hike. We came on our bikes. Check in time ends at 9pm but you can still come in later and pay in the morning, although the gates lock at 11pm for cars. Walkers and cyclists will be able to get in. £9 a per person a night. ",
      "Stayed here a couple of times. Very friendly staff. Camped in the tent field where it can be a little damp but it looks like Scotland has had a wet summer. Caravans and motorhomes have hard standing. Washrooms are clean well equipped and heated. \nWe'll situated for the tourist route up the Ben, and the Nevis gorge and Mamores down the glen. Fort  William is two miles the other way.  Both ways down the glen are ideal for bikes.",

We regretted it instantly when we decided to pop in and see our grandchildren for half an hour on our way home. The management wanted to charge us £5 to 'use their facilities.' When we explained that we would not be using facilities just visiting family the people in the office were rude and belligerent. We left without seeing our grandchildren.\n",

Easy to get to Bournemouth beach, Swanage and the Country parks. \nFood deliveries on site, pizza bike and fish and chips this evening so no need to cater after a busy day. \nClean facilities, quiet at night and friendly service.

Sending your large \"husband\" to kick out someone and their children and put a horrible and abrupt end to their holiday is absolutely disgraceful.

Pull your head out of your asses and admit that it is your fault, sort out the cleanliness and give a refund or invite them back for a full stay, as it is about £600 that she has lost out on now because of selfishness and lack of absolutely everything!!",

The only gripe I would have with the caravan we had was it felt like a after thought on its position , door opened straight into the road as such, no private area to sit. Other problem is hiring through these you do not get the vouchers for the swimming and club and these are expensive to purchase later. However, even with these couple of issues we would go again.",

Food good generally, although the outdoor pizza experience was bad with my pizza being cooked but horrible. Cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella, frozen bits of meat. Poor pizza base. Left half of mine. Site very clean but the time it rained there were hundreds of slugs that came out on the roads - very squelchy under car tyres and foot. Curable with rock salt so not a big gripe. Some nearby roads very narrow and if you rely on satnav to get around try to avoid B roads where possible. Would recommend but we won't be going back as we always go to new places. "

What a lovely little site in a beautiful location which has the benefits of  a small shop & pub on site, which you don;t get at the sites run by the New Forest itself. There were plenty of helpful & friendly staff about at all times. The shower block was lovely, modern & clean. I will most definitely be camping here again! :)",

Just one night and we felt like we had been there for ages. Facilities spotless. Great sandpit! We all loved the shop - hope you found all of flashing stars - sorry, these were a favourite for the girls. Fresh croissants and pain au chocolat a big plus. \nWill definitely be back. Thank you.",
      "Just come back from here. \n\nTaking the New Forest aside, which was just beautiful, the campsite was well kept, and the shower block one of the best I've ever used. They closed it for a deep clean every day, and you could really tell. Never a queue, lots of toilet and shower cubicles. \n\nHowever, the toilet roll dispensers were abysmal, really difficult getting the roll rotating!! \n\nShould give 4.9 really.",

Being close the the shore the views are stunning, plenty of places/routes to walk or jog. ",

Found it difficult to operate the heater at first but the staff very helpful and kimdly assisted. We didn't have light in the second bedroom but again this was sorted as soon as we reported it. Spa facilities, pool and bars were lovely. Loved the location being near the sea. It was nice to be able to go for a walk along the seaside n have fish and chips and ice cream.

      "The camp was very busy on arrival but staff were not fazed by this and they were very polite, helpful and friendly. The camp was kept very clean, there were staff seen every day cleaning inside and out even to the point of cleaning the glass on all the machines in the arcade. The caravan was immaculate and well stocked, we even had a free upgrade to 3 bedrooms. I found the shop reasonably priced for a camp shop, toys for as little as 50p. The mini quad bike track was very reasonable, only £1 per token. The swimming pools were very clean and tidy. All in all we had a great week and will be booking again for next year, I recommend having a go on the pedal bikes, great fun.",
      "A unique holiday park in a woodland setting, far nicer than other caravan parks. It has beautiful lodges & some lovely, quirky privately owned chalets. I don't find the timing of the entertainment great for young children but I'm not too bothered by that. Arcade is fun. Indoor pool could be warmer. But I love it here.",
      "Great little holiday for little ones! Very clean, lovely pool and great facilities for small toddlers. The bar/cafe could do with some updating as a bit dull and lighting is a bit like an office. Food and drink were pleasant and staff were lovely. \n\nFarmer palmers up the road was a lovely farm for a trip out. Also, you can revisit within 5 days for half price.",
      "Great for camping.\nWe stayed on a serviced meadows pitch at the end of August.\nWe had no complaints. There were plenty of toilets and showers on the site and they were always well stocked with loo roll and hand soap. \nWe didn't make use of our entertainment passes, so can't comment on that.\nWe enjoyed the warm outdoor pool, had a meal from the restaurant one night and had a play in the parks and arcade.",
      "Been here 3 times now never had any problems, but after this time never again, the caravan is disgusting, it smells awful, had to go and buy fabric freshener plus air freshener. To get hot water in the bathroom is a fight as well only stay in the caravan to sleep wouldn't even contemplate cooking in there. Don't know about the other facilities as just won't stay on site. Certainly wouldn't recommend anyone to stay at this site shame really as it's in a nice part of the country. Think Parkdean need to step up the cleanliness somewhat!!!!!"

      "Stayed here for 1 week club is small pitch is small and on a steep hill which the kids can't go on bikes or on their scooters ,a lot of noise from walkers by coming back from club,they set off fireworks behind us at 10:30 in the night and my kids woke up screaming \nAll tents and caravans are set together.you are Limited to 50 minutes in the pool\nPeople walking their dogs are not cleaning the mess up after them.\nAnd 5 days In to the holiday their is horse show in the farm next door which is only yards away and with the announcements coming from the speakers starting as early as7:20am  \nPubs in the harbour are very expensive you need to go  about 5 miles away to find a good priced  pub (the cook inn )",
      "This was our first family Caravan holiday.  The location is really nice with views right down to the beach and of the Jurassic Coast.  The facilities are very good with a nice clean toilet and shower block, and convenient places for filling up your drinking water and emptying out your grey water.  We did not use the entertainment side of things so cannot comment on that, but we used the swimming pool once which was quite busy but the kids loved it.  It was only a short walk to the beach, with fantastic views of the the Jurassic Coastline.  There are plenty of places to grab a snack and the pubs served lovely food.\n\nThe only downside was the pitch.  When we booked online it showed views that were flat and not on a small terraced hillside which was difficult for us to manoeuvre the caravan into.  I would say make sure you ask for a non terraced flat pitch unless your happy with the former.",
      "We often go to Parkdean West Bay for our holiday, and each time has been outstanding. This holiday was no exception to that.\n\nThere was a slight hiccup on our part, and Reception Manager Aislinn went so far above and beyond to rectify the problem we caused that you could say she pretty much saved our holiday for us. We simply could not thank her enough.\n\nThe site itself is fantastic. Caravans are well maintained. The indoor pool has a great hydro slide (which my partner, my stepson and I all made full use of). The staff were ALL very helpful, and had great attitudes. The location too is pretty much perfect. It is not too far to go off to near enough anywhere in Dorset. Everywhere was within a 30-40min drive, or easily accessible by bus.\n\nCannot recommend West Bay Holiday Park enough. In fact, we love it so much, we had already booked next year's holiday days before this one ended.",
      "Nice location, caravan was tired and needed  some tlc, small shop on site, bar and restaurant reasonable but food nothing special. Most of the staff are very good, chirpy and helpful.\n4 stars only as caravan needed attention, wall paper patches, shower thermostat hard to adjust, seat creaky and cushions could do with new foam inside. For the price was a little disappointed. Mentioned the creaky seat when we let and they were going to attend to it. \nPerhaps I should have mentioned it before we left but only there 3 nights so didn't want the inconvenience of maintenance people in the caravan.\nWould go back but would check out the age of the van first.\nWest bay in gorgeous with coffee shops, fishing trips, speed boat rides ect.\n",

Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and how courteous and accommodating all the staff were. Facilities were clean and welcoming. The kids loved it and made friends within minutes of our arrival. The entertainment is good also if the arcade area is not your thing. Nearby Weymouth is charming and plenty to see. Hope you're as fortunate with the weather as we were!",

      "Nice Park, great for walking & rugged coastal scenery on the Jurassic Coast. We woke every morning to the sound of the waves crashing on to the beach. The park is ideal for people who want something more natural and for Camping with some comforts around you. It is also a great Dark Park at night - we've were looking forward to seeing the night sky from there as we'd heard alot about it & I can confirm we'd never seen stars as bright as you can from Golden Cap or the Milky Way etc, stunning!! Although there was some challenging weather during our visit we thoroughly enjoyed our few days days away at Golden Cap and would highly recommend this park to anyone seeking a similar kind of break! PS there's also an excellent pub about a hundred yards walk from the park entrance called The Anchor Seatown, which serves great local cask Ales and fantastic food!",
      "Great staff and nice food ! Great views from picnic benches",
      "We had a lovely few days in two of the spotlessly clean and well equipped static caravans.  Views were stunning, staff friendly and the location is great. We hope to go back soon.",
      "On 20th June 17 we booked for 3 days at this site at a cost of £90.45 for 6th July.  At the time of the booking I spoke at length about the procedure for changing the date if we had to.  The reason for this is because my   husband has a serious medical problem and can sometimes have problems for which he needs immediate treatment.  The person on the phone said there would be no problem with this but we would have to pay £25 to change the date.  At no time did she give any cancellation time frame.   My husband was taken poorly on the day we were to arrive and his GP advised him not to travel.  I have now been told that I should have read  the confirmation print details which states that we have to give 21 days notice or lose our money.  I did not read the print as I took her word for it.  I am appalled with their inflexibility, especially given the circumstances and was told that I should contact my insurance company to make a claim.  Unfortunately its difficult to get travel insurance for cancer patients.  One other thing one should consider before booking, you cannot get onto this site until 3pm (half the day gone).  The reason for this is because they allow people to pay to stay on until 3pm at an extra cost.  This was also not mentioned at the time of the booking.   You may say silly me for not reading the booking details but please think carefully before booking this site which sole purpose is making as much money from you as possible, and ensure you read every word of the two page booking form.  I would also point out that this is the first time we have ever met such inflexibility and it is the last time we will book through an agency we shall always book directly with the camp site.",

      "Friendly staff. Generally Clean Park reasonably well maintained. Excellent indoor and outdoor pools. Kids loved the kids evening entertainment and we're over the moon when asked to come on stage to compete for there \"Blue team\" against the yellows. Ate in the on site resteraunt on the first day, food and service were good and the price was reasonable. The menu was a lot like you would expect in a harvester / chain pub. Kids play parks are a little disappointing and really much to small for the number of kids that are sometimes on the park. 10 minutes from the Cove beach is nice but still quite a walk with tired little ones. The Cove end of the beach is mainly pebbles and is steeper than the main  Weymouth beach. Some nice rock pools at the far end for spotting crabs though. ",
      "First time visitors but will definitely be going back. It's a lovely park - smaller and cosy, ideal for families with little children or for older couples just wanting a quiet break... and dog friendly for those who want to take their pet. The accommodation is superb and there are good on-site facilities with a very reasonably priced eating area and a well-stocked shop for self-catering.  Close enough to the centre of Weymouth by bus. Highly recommended.",

      "Seaview is on a steep hill, site packed like sardines thin paths between each van a car space from each other, the seating inside was hard to sit on, double bed the most comfortable place every.  TV was 18\"  only used hob for breakfast frying pan handle got hot and food stuck to it. Came away early, stayed at better Haven sites, only one holiday a year total disaster. Certainly not as advertised.",
      "An Excellent park with really great quality caravans. Staff were all really friendly and couldn't help enough. Great location with easy access to the main roads in all directions so wherever we went out for the day we were there in double quick time. I really couldn't fault our holiday. Thanks guys."

There is a large outside Pool for when the weather is warm and an indoor pool too. There is an on-site shop that is reasonably priced and the site appeared to be really well staffed and run during our entire stay.  The kids entertainment in the evening was great, my daughter loved it!",
      "Stayed here 11th-15th Sept 17 with my friend and her 2 year old daughter. Staff were all very friendly. Entertainment was good. Children's entertainment was excellent. Was given a complimentary upgrade on arrival. Caravan was very clean and kitchen was adequately fitted out for what we needed. Would go again and recommend.",
      "Pleasant experience for a caravan park. Good location and lots to do on site. Caravans were nice and clean, fairly modern but very closely packed together. The lauded beach is not quite what you might imagine but great for younger kids due to it being shallow and no waves. It's a big busy park but staff were always pleasant. The queues at the bars/restaurants need sorting, can see a fight breaking out at some point... Nature Rockz is a nice suprise..",
      "A really great campsite with really friendly helpful staff, lots to do good takeaway options and grocery store. The whole place is very clean, tidy and well staffed. There is a slight downside the prices in the grocery store are slightly higher, also if you try to extend your holiday by a day or two the prices are  very high and close to extortionate on bank holidays. Having said that we had an extremely great holiday.",

Helpful management & clean facilities,there is also a small shop run by friendly staff. Good fun for kids as there is plenty of room to run around. Some of the pitches are on a slope so look first if that is a problem. Walking distance to the excellent smugglers inn which has a good selection of food & beverages.\nA lovely quiet peaceful campsite to relax & holiday.",
      "Had a great stay with a group of mates and our kids. A walk to a fantastic pub and direct access to the coast path. Beautiful sea although the beach is small and rocky so a drive if you want sand. Campsite is roomy with good facilities and a great shop. Very quiet after the 11pm curfew. Well managed. Recommended!",

Would definitely stay again.",
      "This is not the  first time we have been camping with friends and family but when you are frequently warned for making noise by warden while talking with family and friends (not dancing or singing)  before even 8pm, surely no one would prefer this place anymore. In my view people go to camping with friends and family so that they can make the most of it by chatting, making jokes etc but this particular campsite is not perfect for family and friends. If you like to go alone and without children and can stay without noise then it's might be  best place for you.Toilet and shower were nice but there is not mobile network at all. Worst experience ever."

      "We've just returned from a mainly very enjoyable 5 nights at the campsite. The facilities were good with usually clean toilets and showers which were nice, it would be good to have more though as at busy times queues formed but this is common to most sites. I would like to give the site 4 stars but I found the customer service skills of the owners a little lacking at times. When mentioning very politely that one of the ladies toilets had been left in a not very pleasant state the response I received was \"I've already been told 5 times already and I won't be cleaning it! On asking if there may be someone who could do it as I was considering going to get some cleaning products and doing it myself I was told \"The cleaner comes at 12pm tomorrow.\" This was early evening so a long time for one toilet to be out of action! It would be better during busy periods for the cleaner to come twice a day so there isn't such a long time between cleans. I heard there was a similar problem in the men's and a similar attitude was received.\n\nI also find the whole issue of not allocating pitches beforehand quite annoying as when you arrive you have to spend ages trying to decide which pitch to go on and the pitches are a bit haphazard with areas of very poor drainage so pretty boggy after heavy rainfall. We were restricted to what we could be offered due to the weather during the previous week which we understand can't be helped! I understand not all sites pre-allocate due to various reasons but other sites we've been to we have been able to choose our pitch when booking from a good map online so when you arrive you can go straight to your pitch without any faffing about. \n\nI agree with some other's comments that they need to get the basics of the site completely right before spending time and money on a spa as this is more of a luxury which campers don't really expect!\n\nOverall a good camping trip though as we were very lucky to have beautiful weather.",
      "Following our week long stay at this site we have mixed feelings about it. The site is overall quite a good camping/caravan site with an excellent shower/toilet block and small fishing pond which is excellent for children. \nWe did have a couple of issues with the site, those booking a camping pitch without an electric hook up, as we did need to be aware that you will not be placed on the actual site but in a cattle grazing meadow with 12 -18\" long grass, not really what I expect for the cost of the pitch and something I wish I had known before I booked, but the main issue during our stay was how water logged the site became after a couple of days of rain showers. The site clearly has a major drainage issue that needs to be resolved. The main site had large puddles quickly forming on it and a large number of campers either had to move their tents or some simply left. The camping meadow quickly turned into a mud bath which was, in places quite treacherous to walk over as it had vehicle ruts in it full of water, you cannot see them when walking due to the long grass, which is a bit of an issue at night as you can be up to 300 metres from the shower/toilet block when using the camping field. We have stayed on plenty of other campsites over the years and in much worse weather but never seen anything as bad as this.\n\nThe facilities were kept clean but the soap dispenser in the men's toilet was often empty and the washing up liquid dispenser in the washing up room was never filled. The showers were sometimes quite busy, but this is no different to any other site we've stayed on and you didn't have to wait long. \n\nAs in one of the other reviews we found the shop to be closed when it was advertised as open.\n\nSummary\n\nGood Points,\nFacilites\nReasonably quiet\n\nBad Points,\nPoor drainage\nCamping field is not suitable, too far away from the toilets in places and the grass is too long, even if it hadn't have rained you would get soaked walking through it from dew in the evenings and mornings.\n\nPerhaps some investment in drainage across the site would have been better than a beauty spa and hot tub. Get the basics sorted to form a retuning customer base, then indulge in luxury items.",
      "This is a very nice relaxing site, well kept and the toilet and shower facilities are maintained spotlessly. We enjoyed our stay here, the only minor complaint I have is that we were on a hard standing pitch that have hedges to the left and right of the pitch, but the rear is open to the camping field and we had several people walk through our pitch while we were sat outside our motorhome, they were mainly children but there were a few adults who did this. It would be nice if the rear of the pitches were fenced off to prevent this happening. It is only a minor issue and did not spoil our stay.",
      "We found the 'Hideaway' a little over a year ago when we took our caravan down for the first time.......it's been there ever since..!! We did know that there was storage available on site, so thought we would try for a few nights first, which then got extended to a week as we loved the place. Esther & Mike go out of their way to make you welcome, the location and views are fantastic, as are the facilities with everything being spotlessly clean, even when busy. If you have been, you will know what I mean, and if you haven't, get down there, you won't be disappointed.",
      "Amazing campsite with a onsite Spa.  Esther and Mike are the most accommodating people I have had the pleasure of meeting.  Taking care of our every need and even those we didn't know about.  Offering us extra duvets, a barn to stay in and a lift to Seatown when we were stuck."

      "Nice facilities, toilets and showers cleaned twice a day so always clean (occasionally some mud on the floor but considering the amount of walkers nearby, very impressive!). Needed a code to enter so not every tourist nearby testing them. Shop on site, reasonable selection including fresh bread, milk and lettuce. Very friendly and helpful reception staff. Nice bar area as well with good food options (didn't actually eat there but looked good!). Very impressed!",
      "Stayed in a pleasant cottage with excellent facilities and with a bar/restaurant five minutes away. The food and service we're good enough that we ate there six nights out of seven which I don't think is too bad. \n\nThe site is just above the door itself which is a fair climb down but not accessible I'm afraid, you need to be relatively fit and able to get down and up again. But on a fine day it's well worth the effort.",
      "Had a lovely holiday in a privately rented caravan on the site. The site is very clean and well laid out. Easy access to Durdle Door and Lulworth Cove, as long as you don't mind the climb back up!\nOnly criticism would be the wait we had for food in the restsurant on the Sunday evening due to being busy. Ordered just after half seven and by nine still no sign. With others who had ordered meals at 7 still waiting, we decided to call it a day. Our money was refunded along with the cost of our first  drinks and staff were very apologetic.\nWould definitely return to site but probably avoid the restaurant.",
      "Beautiful caravan, lovely staff! \nWe had a great week even though the weather wasn't kind still plenty to do for us and our 3 year old. Mentioned to reception that there wasn't a DVD player as our confirmation stated and within in half an hour a brand new tv with DVD was up and running. We'll be back and will recommend!",
      "A huge and very well equipped holiday park. I went there for camping (end of May) in a nice area along a path which was lined with trees to the left and right.\nBut caution: the conifers were full of crows which were loud and produced a lot of shite. The broadleafs were better to pitch a tent under but turned out to be linden trees so the tent, the car and pretty much everything were covered with a very sticky film.\nIn addition I think the price was a bit to high for one night (26 quid)."

      "A very laid back welcome on arrival and quick to accommodate after asking for a one night stay-told we could choose a spot within a huge area and pretty much left to our own devices! It is one of the nicest campsites we have stayed on-facilities were excellent. My wife is almost OCD about shared public washing facilities but was more than happy to use the ones on site, so that is really saying something! We would definitely come back! ",
      "Camping pods, good value, clean. Not very spacious but good for four people to sleep that's all. Toilet and shower block was looked after and clean.",
      "Great holiday park. Friendly staff.  Clean toilets ",
      "We stayed at The Lookout at the beginning of the school holidays. The site is very clean the showers are brilliant always VERY VERY  clean. The play area is great lots of room for the children too play and kick a ball around   The shop is very well stocked up and the staff are very nice. We will definitely be staying to ago. The price per night is good not a rip off like the well known sites. Also we found the best Fish and chip shop in the uk The Fish Plaice. The look out is  a good place too stay if you like too visit lots of different places ",
      "Loved it, we got a pitch right by the park so the kids could play there until sunset. Lovely clean facilities and a cracking little shop.\n\nWill definitely be returning."

Beautiful surroundings, well-kept facilities, and people most definitely worth meeting.

Be sure to call ahead, because this place stays busy. And big rigs fit just fine, BTW. ",

Now I call to find out that they are totally full and booked.  Nice people but ignorant reservation system.  Beware",

      "We went to inquire about renting an RV spot for a month. The lady in the office was an absolute DOLL!! so sweet, all of our questions were answered, and you didn't feel like you were putting her out by asking more. Clean facilities, store was clean. Docks and kayak/canoe launches were clean. On the beautiful chasshowitzka river, seven sister spring less than 3-400 feet from the launch. Such a cute place! Loved it.  Will be back!! **update** \nWe went back ,as we live a few counties over, and kayaked the chassahowitzka..it was busy! The boat ramps, beach and kayak loading areas were full of people..BUT there was no agitation, people were not meandering around their vessels, they were loading and pulling out so the next set of folks could get in and get out..PERFECT",
      "We were just there and rented a boat for a day-time paddling trip. Very nice area, friendly staff. The river map the shop provides shows the river during \"normal tide\". We had some difficulties finding our way (Salt Creek) during low water level - 4 foot lower.",
      "It's shallow and rocky so not recommended for a boat novice or someone with a huge boat. The water is clear and beautiful. About 60% year round. Great for swimming,  tubing, kyacking and snorkeling. You may see manatees so idle speed please! Don't swim in the brackish water as you get closer to the Gulf because there are lots of alligators residing there. The small bird population will fly up and take food right out of your hand. ",
      "We had a great time camping here for the weekend! We had site 62 and our 5 tents fit fine with extra room to spare! The bathrooms,including the out house were clean and easily accessible! The women at the camp store were very knowledgeable and friendly! There is NO swim area at the camp ground and a canoe/kayak is needed to get to the swim area. They only rent the boats until 4pm and we showed up at 4:05 ( their time...clock on wall was fast). Promised to have them back by 530 as the swim area is two minutes away and she would still not rent to us. That was a big disappointment! The river is dark but beautiful! Seven Sister Spring (swim area) is also beautiful but very slippery and rocky. Not ideal for small children. The only thing stopping me from giving this review 5 stars is the swim area setup, there should be one at the campground, or a shuttle to swim area for campers. Overall we had a great time!!! #PartyOfNine #TheChaz #Lot62",
      "enjoyed my time here especially my time kayaking the river. the spring is amazing and wild life galore! camping with my neighbors so glad we are together but every one is right next to each other when the back half of the campground is empty... wondering why they didn't spread ou out more."

      "This is a great quiet laid-back RV park to spend the night in if you're traveling. It would also be a wonderful weekend or week long stay if you just want to relax. This place is super super clean. From the ground to the office to the enclosed pet area the laundry room the little TV room with a lending library and of course including the shower room and bath facilities... Just super duper clean and that means a lot when you are traveling in an RV!\nStaff is wonderful, gracious and friendly. Prices are very reasonable. There's even some little playground equipment for kids and a soccer field to kick a ball around in or play with your dog.\nPioneer has gone the extra mile to make this a very friendly and cute place to stay. You'll enjoy reading all the little signs in the various buildings and in the bath house. It's that extra little touch that made Pioneer be one of my favorite RV places we stopped in on our trip across the bottom of the US.\nAlso it's really neat that it is behind a gate. You're given a code so you can get an in and out easily but it just gives an extra measure of safety. Don't let the proximity of the highway keep you away. You are far from the noise and Chaos of the highway you don't even hear it once you are in the peaceful surroundings of Pioneer!",

      "Extremely nice campgrounds. Many of the sites are Lake Front. Bathroom and showers are kept extremely clean. Every time I have camped here, I have had a blast from the past. Staff and fellow campers are old school friendly. I have made friends for life while camping here. It is hard to say what was better, the camping /hiking /fishing or the conversations with other campers. \n\nAdded : My most recent pictures showing the campground show it a little overgrown. This is only because of the immense amount of rain they have had in recent weeks.. IMHO, it just shows how dedicated the staff is on keeping this campsite up to par. Absolutely a great staff and campsite. ",
      "We camped here in a Winnebago A, 37ft. towing a car.  Plenty of room in each of the few electric sites with water.  First come, first serve though, no reservations! Loving the peace and quiet.  There are a very few sites along the water, but would be noisier with the boats.  Water only and dry camping also available.  Out of the way place, woodsy.  Back ins only. Several walking trails along the entry road.  Boat dock, all must pay to play!",
      "I've been hearing about this campground for years since my parents frequently came here. It lives up to my expectations and more. There has been improvements since they were here last (late 90s); with more sites, concrete RV pads, new beach and updated wash/shower rooms. There are debit/credit washer/dryers (!), and very nice beach picnic area building. There is a small place area for children with a pirate ship and multiple trails for hiking. The forested areas are beautiful and the view of the pond (I would call it a lake because it's big) at sunset is wonderful. The hosts are helpful and full of suggestions about areas to explore and local activities. We will be back.",

      "Pros:\n• it's located close to Fort Benning's south gate (which is open 24/7). \n• it's neat and well kept, most of the time. it's been rainy and the grass is getting SUPER long, but otherwise they do a nice job of keeping it groomed. \n• the staff are relatively friendly, just don't inquire about the wifi or they'll basically shout at you. it's advertised on the website and works on the rarest of occasions for a minute, or two.\n• the pool is great! \n• there are a few places to do laundry, and it's not terribly priced. \n\nCons:\n• there is NO wifi, but they advertise that there is and then tell you later it's not guaranteed). think you'll just use your data instead, nope. somehow uchee creek is located between cell towers and you'll often have the dreaded 1x. \n• the long term spots are asphalt and not level - we have the most wonderful task of trying to find a way to stop our camper from subsiding into the soft ground. it means our cupboards swing open if not closed properly and the oil sits in the side of the pan of the stove (makes cooking a headache). \n• fire ants are a legitimate issue. our entire \"yard\" area is covered in their mounds and those guys and gals have a nasty bite. i'm terrified of letting my 6 month old anywhere near the ground outside. \n• if you have dogs, make sure they are on tick medication. the whole campground is littered with them, i've even had 2 latch on to me 🤢 and i'm definitely not wandering into tall grass (which is part of why i mentioned the un-cut grass above) or the woods. \n• the laundry is quarters only, which is kind of tedious. can't be that expensive to upgrade to a prepay system, or have quarter machines in the laundry buildings. you have to get quarters from the main office (which is almost a mile away from the long term sites), or go to your bank. \n• most spots are in full sun, and let's face it - Alabama is HOT in the summer. wish there was more shade available."

      "Loved the lots the sizes are amazing. Having the big playground and a smaller playground was nice. Friendly maintenance staff. Showers need to be fixed and stay pretty dirty but we loved the shower sizes and the locking doors on the shower stalls. The manager wasn't very helpful. For a month rent was $850+ because 2 of our children were over six which didn't seem much like a fair or reasonable price. You can't get cable, or internet unless you have a dish which we didn't like very much. Pool isn't heated and is by a very busy highway which we didn't particularly much like either. Over I liked the place but didn't love it.\nPros:\nBig shower stalls\nHuge lots\nSoft grass\nBig playground\nRelaxed atmosphere\n\nCons:\nExpensive if you have children over 6 yes old\nDirty bathrooms\nBathrooms need to be upgraded/fixed\nUnhelpful management\nUnable to get cable or internet",
      "Being that The Stage Stop RV Campground is centrally located to The Happiest Place On Earth -  Walt Disney World - this RV Campground without question,  contributes ZERO with regard to impacting that fact.  Due to Hurricane Irma, my husband and I had to evacuate our home in Fort Myers.  Seeking shelter for a few days, we drove into Stage Stop.  We were greeted kindly by the woman at the front desk.  After processing our payment of our anticipated stay, she circled a map and instructed us where we would be parked.  Questioning if a staff member had inspected the grounds, quite understandably things wouldn't be perfect after Irma's arrival, we were told that indeed it was and our Holiday Rambler would be more than capable of handling the spot location.  Pulling up to our location, my husband and I walked the grounds.  However, three hours after arriving with a $350 in a tow bill that followed - the campground staff was clearly mistaken with their provided false information.  After being towed from the location, my husband and I visited the front office for a refund of the stay we would not be having.  That was granted.  The tow bill was completely placed as our responsibility.  Now, under the circumstances of there being a Category 5 Hurricane and all...I could come to a happy middle ground with this.  Such was not the case of the Stage Stop Staff.  (VIDEO FOOTAGE OF WHAT TRANSPIRED WITH THE STAFF & MYSELF CAN BE FOUND ON THE MOXIE SOCIAL SYNDICATE FACEBOOK PAGE.)  Refusal to give the owner's name and contact number was first indication that this is an RV Campground with no accountability.  The attitude of the staff is not customer based.  The one highly obese gentleman never left his desk and insisted that everything I was questioning was something he \"Didn't catch.\"  \"Repeat that, I didn't catch that.\"  I will be end this review right here.  As a Female VETERAN of the UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS it seems that I can serve my country and very well be called to have died for my country - but asking for the name and number of the owner of Stage Stop Campground due to the incompetency of the staff to resolve our questions or issues is something that I'm not entitled to.  There was neither offer to take down my personal cell phone number for the owner to call me, nor any motivation to try and come to a balance with the situation.  My efforts will now be forwarded in the direction of the Better Business Bureau, The Mayor of Orlando and any Veteran of the United States with regards to this horrific experience.  I would have COMPLETELY been fine with eating a $350 tow bill.  However, I have earned the right to be respected and treated like a human being who has also sustained a lot going through Hurricane Irma.  The ineptitude of the staff to supply basic human decency and customer service is what makes this a Trailer Park.  This is not an RV Resort.  This is not a Campground.  This is a Trailer Park with extremely low standards.  Applicable to themselves and that which is displayed toward customers.  ONE STAR rating is stretching this.  SEMPER FI DEVIL DOGS.  Ooh Rah to my Fellow MARINES.  Disney's Fort Wilderness is worth the extra 45.00 a night.  Please heed my advice on this one.",
      "Love it here, I like the management a lot.there are understanding people. Just be honest with everyone in the office. ",
      "Very clean park. Showers were spacious, the drive threw sights could be a bit wider but was able to maneuver RV into place. I will stay at Stage stop camping when I'm down this way again. 😁",
      "Plenty of space between lots vary nice grounds, well kept."

Swing sets and playground located dangerously next to swampy alligator infested . Code enforcement needs to put an end to this madness. No one was at the beach or playground. Campers in tents and trailers were complaining about no where to swim. Most people would not swim here. But for those from Michigan were their is no alligator's.........if they had a swimming pool,,and a no swimming in the river sign,and a big fence around the playground I would then give this place 5 stars.

Never had any problems with loud campers & didn't ever hear any noise from the roadway, even though the last 2 times we camped close the park's entrance. We will keep coming back here.",

      "We stayed at this park for about six weeks while my husband was in town working.  The park was very clean and exceptionally well maintained.  My husband appreciated the added security of having cameras in the park as they tend to keep honest people honest.  Darlene and Bobby were very accommodating and went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed.  Laundry facility was very inexpensive and worked wonderfully.  There was a even a \"free stuff\" table for other campers to free-cycle things they were getting rid of. The park is conveniently located off I-95 and is just a short distance to Palm Coast and St. Augustine. \nWe will DEFINITELY stay there again when we are in the area!!",
      "This is a great campground!  I've been living here since April this year.  Bobby and Darlene are gracious hosts and bend over backwards to help the guests here.  There are security cameras and a gate to make this feel like the safest of all the campgrounds I've stayed in.  The cameras DO NOT point at anybody's campsite as another reviewer suggested.  They are only pointed at the entrance, exit, dumpster, propane exchange, and clubhouse.  There are no other cameras in the park and they definitely don't point at anyone's rv space. There is a small laundry facility in the clubhouse but that's about it for amenities.  There is a small dock on the creek and a very small gravel boat ramp. I was told there will soon be a small dog run built on the property, as well.  All the full-timers here are extremely friendly and the property is very clean and well kept.  5 stars!!",
      "This is the place we want to be, relatives nearby, boat launches numerous. New owners and the hospitality has not changed great environment.",
      "I was extremely disappointed to discover that the manager has a security camera pointed out at surrounding sites (pointing in the direction of our bedroom window) from his own site which they fail to disclose at check in. Even going so far as to volunteer that there are cameras at the entrance but none in the park for the sake of our privacy which was an outright lie. I was spoken down to on more than one occasion by the manager who in my opinion has a problem with women. Witnessed him on more than one occasion speak poorly about certain guests of the park  in the presence of other campers even calling one woman a \"pain in the ass\" which appeared very unprofessional in my opinion. I felt intimidated by this man and would not return based on that.  Gave the park one star due to the owner Jerry who was very gracious and professional. Park is clean and simple. Mostly long term residents.",

Some sites can be a bit close together, but there were very few people there when I went. \n\nThere are two types of sites here, spurs and park/pitch a tent sites. I chose the spur because my car is my tent. \n\nTo pay, you pull up to the main entrance, grab an envelope and then drive to your site. After filling out the relevant details and hanging the paper placard on your mirror, you walk the envelope with the fee in it to the deposit box at front.",

As others have noted, the trails area not particularly well marked, but with a GPS app for one's phone, or a paper map, it's relatively painless to find one's way around. Also, the road has been repaired and is smooth asphalt all the way to the campground as of Spring 2017. If you have the time and inclination to hike a bit for some great views, one can go past the Falcon Campground, then turn left and head up the Main Divide road (which a high clearance vehicle can drive) to Los Pinos Peak.

      "Very pretty area. Well kept. Water and showers were available. Site 6 is spacious but is next to a vault toilet - smelly on a hot August weekend. (Maps of the area show a different location for the toilet.) You also have to park your car about 30 feet from your campsite. The area is buggy - more gnats than mosquitos. The road is also very near - probably not a problem most of the time, but we were there for the Perseids and it was really busy. Some sites were well shaded, but site 6 was shady only in the early morning and late afternoon and it was hot. Sky viewing was spectacular very near our spot. ",
      "Nice campground.  Unfortunately, mosquitoes were out of control.  We made the unfortunate mistake of camping at site #6 which has a little \"creek\" running behind it...but it was mostly standing water...which was a breeding ground for the mosquitoes.   The mosquitoes were worse there than any other campsite.  \n\nWe will return but just not at that particular site.  We made our breakfast in the morning and literally walked over to another empty campsite to eat it.  It was a little annoying.  Just unfortunate luck for us.\n\nThey had showers there but two dead bolted shut and out of order. The two that were open had quarters jammed into the machines so they were inoperable at the time. So basically, no showers. \n\nWe booked our site for three days but ended up leaving a day early due to lack of showers and the insane amount of mosquitoes. Also, the pit toilets are right next to site #6.  It's not shown properly on the map. The map shows it between the camp entrance and site #4...and closer to the entrance. In reality the pit toilets are between #4 and #6...with it being closer to #6. \n\nA quick note... Sites on the outer  loop have more shade but also more bugs. Sites in the inner loop have virtually no shade but far less bugs. There's a trade off here. \n\nWe had a raccoon visit our campsite both nights so make sure you pack up your food at night. He was a cute little fella. \n\nI'm giving the site three stars because the showers were broken and the misrepresentation of the pit toilets on the map. Had I known, I would have never booked that site because who wants to smell poop all day at their campsite.  No star deductions for bugs...because this is Camping in the woods and we should have come better prepared with a screened in canopy.",

      "Has the best motorcycle riding roads getting up there! Observatory was nice too!",

      "Great RV park and staff. Super kind, wonderful location. Close enough to Savannah that we've taken daily drives to the historic district. Also within walking distance to two beach areas. Clean pool and good sized sites. Shade trees on some of the spots too.",
      "Although we did not end up camping here, our experience with their customer service was extremely disappointing.  Because of Hurricane Irma, we called to get a status of the campground and got a recording stating they were closed until further notice.  That along with the posting on their website implied they had no idea as to when they could reopen.  The phone message further stated that because of the Hurricane, they were providing refunds if you wished to cancel.  We sent an email as they required requesting cancellation and refund and booked a new campground.  They then responded saying they would only provide a 6 month guest credit.  After several emails explaining how we are travelling from Arizona and had to make alternate arrangements to insure we had camping facilities for the remainder of our trip, we were basically told too bad.... no acknowledgement of their prior phone message or website statements.  So as of right now we are out our deposit.  In all fairness, we knew the policy for refunds when we booked, but I see this as extenuating circumstances both because of the Hurricane and their phone message. Yet they offered no compromise of any kind.  They basically told us to go ahead and say whatever we felt we had to on social media... apparently they don't care about public image.  This may be because they appear to owned by the city.  My recommendation is to search out other alternative camping especially if travelling during Hurricane season.",
      "We loved this campground. Nice roomy, shade  lots. Friendly staff. Great pool/laundry facilities. Shower/bathrooms were clean and working.Close to the beach so no need to pay the high beach parking fees-You can walk to the beach.",
      "Excellent location on Tybee Island!  Close proximity to beaches, shopping, and restaurants.  Bikes and/or golf carts are highly recommended!  Many nearby rentals available and will deliver. Grounds staff were very friendly and helpful.  Camp sites have very limited space, shade, or privacy, but very clean.  Loved the community pool and laundry facilities.  Beware of mosquitoes and have fun exploring  the island!",
      "As far as campgrounds go this little one is very nice. Very clean and orderly. Cabins are small but nice. Short walk to the beach and lighthouse"

      "Super nice campsites .. we stayed at site 18. Close to bathroom and seems a larger campsite. The people working were super friendly. They came by and ask us if we needed any wood. I will be staying here again",
      "We took our young kids on their first camping trip here. While our neighbors were friendly and the campground was nice, we chose the wrong weekend. It was 4th of July. We chose this specific campground because of the strict rules of no drinking, no smoking, and quiet time starts at 9. None of these rules were implemented. The host was stuck at the front gate to allow cars to leave. We had to leave by 10:30 because our kids couldn't sleep. \n\nWe will try again another time.",

Wouldn't give us a refund told us we have to wait till Monday to talk to the assistant manager! Cold showers after 3 minutes! Super long grass, not taken care of at all! Didn't have cable or sewage hook ups for my wife's parents RV. The ones that do have water hook ups didn't have electricity! Do not waste your money guys! 5 minutes down the road is a lot nicer camp ground!",
      "Where to begin.... Staff is very friendly....cabins are junk... The pool is loaded with unsupervised kid's from open til close....they should consider having a adults only from 7pm til 9 so you can enjoy the pool for a bit without screaming kid's...and i do love kid's but i don't want to babysit other people's kid's that need supervision...bathrooms and showers need major upgrades they are gross except for the new one that closes at 9....they all should look nice...it's a beautiful area that needs much care and upgrades!!",
      "The staff was rude and they charged us $10 for electricity hookup which we requested but assigned us a place where an RV hooks up when we told them we had a tent. It's a very pretty place and the campers are nice. Bathrooms are nasty but have decent water heat and pressure and the pool is nice. They close at 5pm and their maintence never answers their phone. No grills anywhere. Won't return.",
      "As a campground It wouldn't be my first choice. Cabins needs to much to mention, nothing for kids no activity's to do except swim and fish, every site don't have water and electric or picnic tables the grass almost always is cut and trimmed neat. Most of the staff is friendly camp store is under stocked and small but has plenty of beer and cigarettes. office is not open late .seams to cater to retired campers. Not family friendly.  With some changes this campground  could be  a beautiful and fun camping experience for everyone",

Most of the trailers there are seasonal for a reason and I would recommend Lake Breeze to anyone . My Wife and I have decided to purchase a trailer and a seasonal lot for next season . You couldn't ask for better service as the owner Todd Allen was walking the campground attending to any and all needs even while he was camping with his wife Kim . Lake was full of fish and water was extremely warm .Amazing experience that has made me fall in love with camping .",

      "PLEASE READ ALL OF THE REVIEWS. This park obviously does not care about their bad reviews. We drove from Orlando to check out the park for a future visit.  When we spoke to one of the clerks and told her our 5th wheel was 44 feet long, she literally stepped back and put her hands up in the air stating we were too long.  We drove from Orlando since their web site says they can handle RVs of any size.  We left and looked at the park to see sights which could accommodate our rig.  We went back in and pointed out these sites and told them of their web site.  They stated only rigs 40 feet and under could stay there. With their attitude we would have not stayed there . We called corporate to ask them about their web site but they never returned our call. I believe their biggest issue was our 7 year old son staying there with us.",

      "I paid 100.00 deposit for Bikeweek, after calling 2 ladies told me that our unit would not fit, due to the fact we side load and we would have to unload and load in the street, we were not doing that and cancelled, they will not refund my deposit. Thief...Hope you have a good time with me 100.00",
      "We had the worst experience with the management. We asked to stay long term and we paid 3 months in advance. After the first month we were told that we were getting kicked out because our RV was more than 15 years old. There are at least 10 other RV's that are over 20 years old but none of them had to leave! I asked for proof of that rule and the manager told me that they have no such rule in written form. They kicked us out for no reason. The manager gave me the vice president of the RV resort's phone number and she never returned any of my phone messages.",
      "Stayed there for month of December.We had to fly home for a family emergency on Nov 28th .We called the park to see if we could check in before our reservation date of Dec 1st. There was already someone on our site til the 1st.We spoke to Ginette who as always was very pleasant and caring.When we arrived at the resort, we were pleasantly welcomed by Ginette  who made it possible for us to park on our reserved site right away.Sun RV is lucky to have her on their team."

Cable TV and WIFI worked good to. There was always an employee out on the golf cart doing something. I had three small kids and two dogs, we did our thing, followed the rules and it was a great place to camp.",

I called before hand (lots of shortages due to Hurricane Irma's impending doom) and I spoke with Sharon, who was very nice.  She told me she had plenty of propane.  I drove up there and met with a nice man on a golf cart.  I asked him to fill my tank and he politely obliged.  While standing by, I noticed that the park was somewhat deserted.

      "KOA RV campground with very nice owners.  Caters to the older, no kids, crowd (no playground or pool), caters especially to people interested in the Daytona Speedway (just down the highway) or bike week (no tent camping).  Airport and Embry Riddle Aeronautical U are very close.  The beach is several miles down the highway and over a bridge to the barrier island.  Price is right if you just need to park your RV and don't mind the traffic noise (cars and planes - not bad).  Only AC'd bathroom has 2 stalls, one sink, and one shower for the women (the other bathroom is not AC'd, similar separate bathrooms for men), older construction but clean, little activity in mid- August.  As with most RV camps, having a car helps.",

      "I'm sick of all the reviews saying it is noisy.   Yeah, the airport is nearby but I haven't heard a single plane or jet, as this is on the west side of I-95 and the airport is to the east of 95.    It is not anymore noisy than anyplace else in Daytona Beach, New Smyrna Beach, Port Orange, etc.   \nIt is not noisy.  It is very quiet."

      "Very comfortable and quite family campground, the staff will try to make your stay the best that It can be. They have a commercial grade playground for the kids and a fifty foot swimming pool where you can take a dip and lounge under two large cabanas, a camper kitchen with free use of the grill to cook your food and then after relax by the community fire pit or request your own fire pit and have a personal fire at your campsite. if out door or RV camping is not your thing they also have home away from home cabins. This is a cool place to bring the family and hang out for a few days or maybe longer ",
      "My husband and I just returned from a weekend here. Awesome cabins!! Very neatly maintained grounds and friendly helpful staff. Will definitely be staying there again!!",
      "Our stay was pleasant and my opinion of the staff is that they do a good job and treat guests well.  The grounds however are in need of a lot of improvements.  Our campsite (#334) for 4 nights was a patch of dirt/ grass surrounded by more overgrown grass with a dirty concrete pad.  To be fair, it has been raining a whole lot and I can imagine it is tough to keep the grass cut.  Site is also next to an eyesore of a rig that looks like it hasn't been used in quite some time.  In fact, there are multiple rigs in the park that need to be hauled away and the sites fully refurbished.  There are many full-timers that are simply out of control with junk everywhere.  This is just unacceptable.   This was all very disappointing as we paid almost $250 for four nights.  This is not $62.00 per night park especially when you can stay at nearby state parks with far better aesthetics for far less money.  \n\nAll of the sites (except for the premium sites) need to be cleaned up, landscaped, and new picnic tables installed.  We did not have a picnic table but the gentleman who showed us to our site offered to help me move the one from the site door.  I declined because the table was in really bad shape with rusty screws sticking out, etc.  This is what I mean, the overall appearance of the Daytona Beach KOA is very \"run down\" with the exception of the limited number of premium sites which have bushes, gravel, and other amenities.    \n\nIt is really nice though that the staff enforce the rules and keep the noise level down.  They are also diligent about picking up the trash.  Bathrooms are in very good repair and, very clean when I used them.  Bottom line, I would stay here again if things get repaired and if each site was defined and manicured/refurbished.  Lots and lots of potential for this campground to be really great.  I am hoping the owner will read this review and take the constructive criticism as cue to make the much needed improvements.  As it stands, I would not recommend this campground for those seeking a nicer place to stay.  The response from the owner (below this review) is the same response he's given to others who express concern but it doesn't appear things are improving.",
      "My family always enjoy their stay at this campground.  They have a great pool, JUST put in a new sturdy playground for the kids this weekend.  The staff is the best, the guys will do just about anything for you.  I'm out setting up the camper and Jack comes over and hands me a cold bottle of water.  The Ladies at the front desk are wonderful.",
      "Great Campground.  Stayed during Bike Week.  Really enjoyed it.  Sure its tight when its full but I still loved that the bathrooms were clean, the Staff was Excellent and on top of it all WE HAD FUN!  Breakfast was an added bonus.  I've already made my reservations for next year and I am bring friends."

      "I was here years ago when ABATE of Florida ran it and it was great, the security the hot showers even the people running it were amazing and helpful.  This past week there was no hot water for showers there was no security  (if you acted like you were looking for a wrist band they let you in). The people weren't bad but but overall not the place it use to be. It is a cheap campground I might stay at again but with out hot water probably not. On a side note the food vendor on sight charged $4 a (small) bag of ice...highest price I have ever paid for a bag of ice. ",
      "While the man that runs this, Troy, seems like a great guy..... a business is only as good as the people with whom you entrust the daily tasks. I have to give this a 1, and if I could give it a zero, I would. Here is why, we were there from Friday to Sunday and the bathhouses had not been cleaned at all. The floors had the same, only more, mud on it Sunday that it did Friday afternoon. There was no soap to wash your hands nor paper towels to dry them. The door on the men's room would get stuck closed, forcing one to put all your weight against it to force it open. I brought this to their attention on Friday and was told \"well....that's probably because the \"carni people\" used this area for the fair\". When we left Sunday.....it was the same\n\nThe trash cans on the RV side were not emptied from Friday morning till Sunday at 11am. Needless to say, they were overflowing and the smell was pretty bad.\n\nThe RV sites are only 15 feet wide. You could not open your slide and open a canopy because you would be outside of your assigned space. You had two choices..... choose the slide being open or having the canopy up......or buy another space. Believe me, they DID monitor if you were staying within your lot or not.\n\nThe swap meet left much to be desired. It was very small, MAYBE 12-15 vendors at most. There was \"FOOD\" advertised in the numerous flyers and yes, there appeared to be a food vendor, MAYBE two food vendors. Luckily our admittance to the swap meet was free with our camping cost.\n\nThe business structure seemed very week. On the first day of bike week none of the workers seemed to have been briefed on the operation and the result was customers being put to a disadvantage. This was not very pleasing.\n\nSo in summary, if you would like to stay with some pretty nice folks who do not clean the bathrooms/bath houses, nor empty the trash.....then this could be a great spot for you. The price for the RV sites was only $50, but unfortunately it would not be money well spent to spend your time in sub-par conditions.",

All RV spaces are back in only. Do not visit during bike week if you want peace & quite. But other times it is a very quiet &  relaxing place to park your RV to enjoy your visit in N.S.B.",

Live shrimp, secured grounds, well lite. Bath house, hot showers in remodeled inboard/outboard bathrooms! More Manatee than Blue Springs, they all stay in the boat slip canal behind camp. Sit on the dock and they swim feet from you. It was very cool. Camped on the intercoastal, very peaceful setting and very quite,. We will be back. Thank you.",
      "The staff is extremely rude especially if you bother them while closing and if you have an expensive car they cut the grass flinging it all over your car.  The prices are way over priced l suggest you go somewhere else this place along with management are crooks charging way over price because we decided not to make them our home due to their own lack of good customer service.  We found a better rv park with extremely friendly staff and reasonable pricing with more space waterfront.  They have gone above and beyond to accommodate our family in relocating from Indian mound fish camp.  Mark my words  do not take your family to indian mound fish camp they are way overpriced and unfriendly.  Their are much better accommodations elsewhere their motives is to keep short term for greed of money. Beware I've warned you!",

      "After talking with him over phone, we decided to go for overnight safari. Yogi came to pick us up since we stayed in different hotel and settled us in his guesthouse before headed out to camp. On the way to camp he asked what we wanted to eat or drink so he could buy beforehand. It turned out we got so much food and drink that we could not finish even half of them. The huts were simple but got what you need. And camel ride was fun and our one year old baby enjoyed the most. Unfortunately it was raining that night so could not see the sky. Second day we went back to his guesthouse after lovely breakfast next to hut. He offered one room for us to stay in the whole afternoon for free since our train was at 8pm and also because of the little baby. At the end, Yogi sent us to station by his car. We enjoyed the time there and Yogi would treat you like real friends! When you are in Bikaner, make sure you call him and find out.",
      "Our group of five had an amazing experience. It happened to be my birthday while we were there, and Yogi went out of his way to ensure it was one of my most memorable yet! The camel trek was nice, but our favorite part was actually sleeping overnight in the desert. The dance performance and dinner were amazing, and we had such a great time relaxing beneath the stars in a unique setting. Yogi - thank you so much for the birthday cake and sweets, and for creating a wonderful and unique desert experience! Definitely recommend if in Bikaner.",
      "There are small place for see thar. In bikamer have other resort. There are no staff available and behaiver of landloord is not good waste of time and wast of time.",
      "Wonderful place to be. Excellent experience and most important the owner yogendra ji is such a nice person to be with.",
      "It's place is beautiful only in pictures waste of money it's landlord behaviour is not good.\nDo not suggest for rao bikaji go other  resort."

      "This is a splendid campsite located amongst the only significant clump of trees in the area. All the amenities are modern and well maintained. Be warned however, this part of the world is extraordinarily hot and the shade and the swimming pool may not be enough to save you.",
      "not too bad but planting a tent isn't that easy, hard ground...\nbeing the nearest place to the canyon, no real competition unfortunately.",
      "Hobas campsite is the closest you can get to staying at the Fish River Canyon with the NWR (Namibia's park service) but you're still about 10km away from the rim. You have first shot at visiting the canyon at sunrise and can stay just past sunset, which is great for photographers. The campsite is pretty spread out, so if you're anti the overland truck crowd, be sure to pick a plot far away from their groups. Decent ablution blocks but don't expect hot water in the showers. Bring all the food and water you need with you because the small tuck shop only sells snacks. Also, be sure to bring enough cash to pay for the campsite (no ATM, no internet, etc.). This is a pretty remote campsite down a long gravel road, so be sure to plan accordingly.",

      "The camp is run by fraudster, we went with a group of 19 people and made an advance booking. We paid approximately 20000 for this and when we reached there the camp people said that we don't have any booking from you. We had to stay in a different camp and pay again for the stay which we have already paid for...people in Ladakh are nice but these guys are exceptions and they should be left alone",
      "I had been to Manali this August with 2 of my friends. We had planned for 3 days and 2 nights package from Manali - Keylong-Sarchu and back with Antrek Tours. All the arrangements made was more than satisfactory as they treated us more like a family member then their customer. Mr. Naushad was prompt and very responsive at his end while he provided us with Scorpio and the driver was very much experienced and confident one, though we would be afraid to see the narrow rough hilly roads ahead of us, we totally enjoyed the ride. Also, the lodging and camps in Keylong and Sarchu were  neat and clean. Coming to food, many options were available for breakfast and dinner according to your choice like breakfast itself had bread,butter, jam, chappati, milk, oats, omlet, tea or coffee anything and dinner was also superb. At the end, I must say.. Those places are indeed worth visit a lifetime but what makes it more beautiful is when you are treated really well and everything goes with your expectations.",

      "Hi Guys, We have just returned from Leh. I would like to share my experience while my stay in Sarchu. We booked 10 tents in ANTREK Camps for my group of 20 people and pre paid 17100 rs. On 13th July our batch along with reached Sarchu and asked for our stay. They denied that we don't have any confirmed bookings for you even after paying the full amount. As every one knows that their is no network. I joined this group in Leh. I tried to contact Mr. Naushad about this incidence. Mr.  Naushad said that his group manager is saying that our group did not reach to them. And thats the first part of story.  While going back I was along with the group. I asked my Naushad if he can give give some discount and arrange 9 tents for us as we already wasted our money. I reached Sarchu on 19th around 9 PM.  At a very cold his manager Tiara denied our stay again.. This made me  angry it was  just like looting people specially when you don't have network. I forced his him to call Mr. Naushad through satellite phone and we got our stay.  Then I asked him whether my group and my brother reached to you on 13th. He said yes,  but we didn't get any bookings so we did not allow them to stay. This is very bad of them,  They are making people fool. Breakfast was bad. Burnt egg bhurji with bread and water like tea. Paid another 9000 for stay and gave him review but he was like I don't care... He said talk to our owner where we don't have network..."

Lovely swimming pool on the edge of the cliff. One of my favourite places in Iceland. Recommended to visit. ",

We didn't use the shower, since we used one at the pool nearby, but it also looked clean and spacious. (No timer, included in the price, has hot water). The town is not much - we were drawn to the amazing pool and hot tub on a fjords cliff - well worth it! Town was eerily empty and quiet, except for a small amount of ppl at the pool in the evening.

The hammocks with mosquito nets were hammocks within a greenhouse like facility with nets instead of windows. No individual mosquito net on each hammock. I got lucky with bedbugs (chinches) in my hammock. \nThe only reason I rate this place with two stars is to distinguish between the even worse place one beach further at Cabo San Juan. \nThe beach isn't worth it.

Don Jacobo es un señor serio y muy amable.\nHay agua potable (*primordial* porque en otros sectores del parque es bastante costosa), se alquilan campings, amacas y zonas para acampar. Se puede cocinar en leña, también hay baños. Una excelente opción para desconectarse, socializar y aprender.",

Desde la primera vez que fui me hice muy amigo de ellos conociendo incluso anécdotas familiares! Muy recomendado! La playa arrecifes está a 5 minutos a pie de la zona de camping."

Horrivelmente desconfortável. Tudo é caríssimo e o olho grande chega ao ponto de cobrarem até pra carregar o telefone na tomada.  Sem falar em 10.000 cops por um cadeado pra pôr a mochila num armario. Infraestructura péssima, filas pra tomar banho, para ir no banheiro... Me senti de volta ao acampamento do Fórum Social Mundial.

      "Location is nice and silent, but the showers in the service building were rather strange. While newly renovated, the single person shower rooms didn't have any bench or dry place to be while dressing after taking a shower. It is impossible to leave the place with dry feet and socks on, unless you are willing to put your towel on the floor. Also, the hot water only lasted for 2 minutes (maybe I was just unluckywith the timing). The kitchen was probably great in its glory days back in the 80's, but two boiler plates and a sink isn't good enough in 2017. We, the campers, want the same amenities that we have in our own homes. The playground was small and worn, and it had an old motorcycle without a seat and with old wires hanging from it. It didn't strike me as a proper toy, to say the least. There was also an old battery driven play car (the kind children can sit on and drive) which of course didn't work. The only real plus I can think of is the site's great location by the river.",

      "The best managed campsite we have been on in Sweden so far. We stayed there in August. The place was neither crowded nor empty. Probably 30% of the slots were taken. \nThere was a team of about 10 young people that did work and travel. They kept everything in good shape. The bathrooms were exceptionally clean at all times. Some of them consisted of one big room with a shower, toilet and ample place to change clothes. \nThe beach is public. At the weekend and with good weather the beach was rather crowded. But that never was a problem as there is a big lawn just a few meters from the beach with access to the lake that was quite at all times. \nThe lake is incredible. We brought an SUP an crossed the two connected lakes. Beautiful. \nThere is a chance to rent a canoe for everyone that does not have a boat. \nThe campsite has a nice restaurant that we did not try but it looked nice.",

Glass såklart.  Möjlighet att spela minigolf. \n\nStugan för fyra personer var lagom stor med ett rymligt badrum! Helt ok bäddsoffa och våningssäng med 120 cm i botten.

Desde el parking hay que cruzar el riachuelo por el puente de madera. Atraviesas la zona cercada y pasas al otro lado de la cerca de madera, en línea recta. Comienzas a subir hasta que encuentres una senda en dirección hacia la izquierda. Continúas la senda en ascenso dejando el río a tu izquierda durante todo el camino. Cuando acaba el sendero tienes que continuar un poco hacia la derecha. Verás las ruinas de las cabañuelas y una planicie que era la antigua zona de cultivo. Parece que hay otra zona para bajar, pero no fui capaz de encontrarla. No está señalizada, ni tampoco está clara donde se toma la posible senda.

Pay cash, no kredit or debitcard.\n \nNice showers, toilet are outhouses, so they smell a bit, and that's why they don't get 5 stars. Nice kitchen, GREAT VIEW! Seriously kind people.\nI'm marking this place, as a favorite!",

Next to the site for tents is a little hut were you can sit with some books And maps of the area, no cooking facilities though. You could perhaps do barbecue. There is no swimming area, just boats, so it's probably best for people who want to hire a boat. ",

Foto) und die Wendland-Therme mit ihrem umfangreichen Sauna- und Badeangebot. Dort eingebettet findet sich zudem ein Fitness-Studio. Ebenso zu Fuß zu erreichen: der Gartower See mit Angelmöglichkeiten, Tretbootsverleih usw. \n\nDen Platz selbst kennzeichnet ein wunderbarer Baum- und Heckenbestand. Selbst bei nahezu voller Belegung hat man das Gefühl, nur mit einigen wenigen Gleichgesinnten mitten in der Natur zu campen. Wenn man dann wie ich noch gerne fotografiert, begeistern die Motive, die man schon auf dem Gelände des Campingparks hört und sieht: Nachtigall-Konzerte im Frühjahr, Schmetterlinge aller Art im Sommer usw.\n\nMeine Ausflugs- und Tagestouren-Tipps in die Umgebung: Grenzland-Museum in Schnackenburg, Rolling-Stones-Museum in Lüchow, Seeadler-Turm vor Nienwalde, die Nemitzer Heide , das Gartower Wildgatter und der Aussichtsturm Schwedenschanze, um nur einige bereits angesteuerte Plätze/Orte zu nennen. Fazit: Es gibt rund um den gut geführten Campingpark jede Menge zu entdecken.",

      "We headed to Camping Los Arenales, just five minutes away from downtown Almagro, and stayed for two full days. We are in love with the place. First, it costs a fraction of the Hospedaria de Almagro where we stayed the night before (€13.50 vs €65–tent vs room), has wonderfully hot water in the showers, swimming pool (it was closed in May), barbecues, restaurant, cafeteria, (very good) wi-fi, laundry, playground, cabins, and RV and tents spaces. We defined it as a low-key, quiet, rural resort.\n\nWe settled at the cafeteria to use the wi-fi, while a few lively, older gentlemen drank white wine by the bar. I order a delicious red wine from the region (Castilla La-Mancha), and was very surprised to be served a tapa with it. It was a small piece of bread with a seafood-tomato sauce (better than any tapas I have had so far in Spain). I order a second glass. This time, I was served a small plate with white beans in vinaigrette (second best tapa in Spain).\n\nThe camping is not perfect. The bathrooms need remodeling and we found some areas to be quite abandoned. The Spanish authenticity and slow pace was what got us, though, and we recommend stopping by if you ever make it to beautiful Almagro.",
      "Great fun",
      "I was scandalised by the owner of this camping. The night before I asked permission to use my laptop inside the restaurant because of the limited connexion and the use of the socket for power. No problem at all according to the staff. The following day after ordering two coffees I wanted to use the same table in the completely empty restaurant but I was yelled at by the owner. Although I apologised and said this was a mistake because the day before I was granted permission by his staff he continued to yell at me. The reason: the one small table I used was compromised by me. The night before I had moved one of the two dishes on that table and replaced it in exactly the same place and order. Franco regime all over again. By the way no possibility of breakfast. A supermercado in the reception hall which wasn't worth the name of supermercado. The restaurant itself was OK for a camping. The sanitary block was adequate.",

      "I want to give this place one star because of what I will address later. However, I cannot give one star because the staff at the restaurant were so lovely and sociable. They cooked me up a great curry wurst for a good price. The thing that I had a problem with was the awful old man at reception. He took one look at my passport, saw that I was American, and immediately let out a big, \"UGH.\" Later I tried to buy a shower token and he said \"No more showers for today.\" I had rode my bicycle 110km to this camp spot and I really wanted a shower. Him and his friend laughed at me, then said I could just wash myself in the sink. With enough despiration, finally he told me to come back in 20 minutes. I came back 20 minutes later and he \"graciously\" offered to sell me one token worth 3 minutes of water. I was pretty upset with the attitude of this guy, but I didn't show it. I'll just let him live out the last few miserable years he has left with his shallow small mind. But like I said before, the staff at the restaurant were very kind and made me feel at home. They were very good people.",

We found a semi private spot near the trees away from the other travelers, cooked dinner on their parilla, and took a quick dip in the adjacent river to beat the heat.

      "Il papagayo è un posto splendido, ma l'idea di campeggio che hanno qui è comica o meglio, tragica. La notte staccano la corrente, le docce si fanno solo all'alba e al tramonto, nessun servizio di ristoro o market e, a parte tre chiringuiti nella spiaggia vicina occorre arrivare a Playa bianca per tutto. Ha, dimenticavo, è aperto solo 2 mesi d'estate. Meglio rimanere in libera.",
      "Deze 'camping' ligt in een dorre omgeving en onbeschut in de zinderende hitte, is volledig afgesloten dmv een hekwerk, alle caravans en tenten staan op elkaar geplakt en het lijkt daardoor meer op een vluchtelingenkamp. Ik mis alleen de bewakingtorens en de bedelende handen door het hek nog. Ik kan maar moeilijk voorstellen dat je hier voor je plezier wilt vertoeven. Schrecklich!",

The Villa offers dorm rooms and double rooms, roof terrace, surf lounge, pool and BBQ with a huge table. A real deal if you want to have a great surf holiday!  \n\nThe surf camp and the surf teaching is high-quality with a 5 students per instructor ratio, and the longest hours spent on the beach!  "

No toilet paper available, which is a big disappointment for such an expensive place. Really loved the lavatories for dishes because you can use your hip to press the button while your hands are free to do the washing. \n\nPitch areas are not divided in any way.... Just a moderate size area of grass and some trees for all the tents, but picnic tables are available there, 3 grills, 2 water sources, plastic tables and chairs, bike stands, good grass most of the place. In September 18.46€ for 2 people on bikes (pay extra for electricity and pay extra for Wi-Fi)"

If you're old or in general like nothing to do other then walking through the forest, then it's the place for you.\n\nHowever, I guess, when you are on a big camping tour and sleep here for 1  night to leave right on the next day, it is okay as well - quiet.\n\nOnly highlight was TROPICAL ISLAND (Swimming).",

      "Wirklich ein sehr schöner Campingplatz.\nEs gibt 2 Gründe warum der Platz aber, obwohl sauber, schön und gepflegt einen Stern Abzug bekommt.\nScheinbar gibt es hier keine Mittagsruhe. Der Betreiber mäht Rasen, schottert Wege neu und andere laute Arbeiten und dies leider fast immer zwischen 11 und 14Uhr.\nMittagsruhe ist somit nicht möglich. \nEine anderer Grund ist, dass in der Nähe ein Schießanlage ist. Diese Anlage scheint von der Bundeswehr betrieben zu werden, wodurch teilweise öfter Schüsse zu hören sind. Uns hat es nicht gestört aber denke mit kleinen Kindern oder schreckhaften Hunden ein Problem. \nSonst ist der Campingplatz absolut zu empfehlen.\nAchtung an Angler, der Luckower See scheint sehr sehr schwach besetzt zu sein. Weißfische kann man gut fangen. Mehr wollte bei mir aber nicht ab den Hacken.\nDer See ist auch sehr verkrautet. Spinnfischen ist nur vom Boot aus möglich.",

Hotel consists of 4 parts, each of them has an own swimming pool (you can freely move between the parts), there are also some bars and restaurants. The food is really a top class, I don't remember eating such a good food before in a hotel, localization is also nice (10 mins to the beach through the town's cultural center), the bungalows are clean and tidy, but would benefit from a little refurbishement, though. The staff is also really nice and helpful. Minus one star for the fact that you can use pools only till 6pm and that a water park is open only about 2hrs around the noon. Mini golf is also quite outdated (and you need to pay to play it!). ",
      "This is a very tired hotel . Nothing in the room,so you either rent of the hotel,or buy in the local shops.This included kettle etc.The condition of the room was poor,and housekeeping was as bad.The food in the restaurant was good though,with plenty of choices,so at least ending on a positive.",

      "This was the worst value for money of all the campsites in France. It is noisy, barking dogs, road noise, shooting range close by. The site is untidy and the welcome was unfriendly. We just couldnt find anywhere else close to Toulouse. So its this site or nowhere else. The hot water was just warm in the showers.\nWe were glad to leave early the next morning.",
      "Campsite popular with most nationalities well place for access by cycle to centre of Toulouse.",
      "In the outskirts of Toulouse, it's well located for visiting the city and quite convenient if practicality is what you're after: Nearby there's a broad commercial drag (outlet stores, furniture shops, offices, logistics companies, that kind of place) with a few large restaurants, and the city centre isn't far away. On the other hand, it's also in a dodgy-looking area, not the kind of place where you might go for a quiet walk (particularly at night)\n\nThe proximity to the city may be a plus, but is a major drawback if peace and quiet is what your after (it also seems to attract a certain kind of people; the opposite of those who seek nature and tranquillity, so to speak). We had the misfortune of staying there on a Saturday night, and between a group of drunk, noisy 20-year-olds and the booming of what sounded like an open-air club, judging from the noise level (This was in December...), it wasn’t at all my ideal location. Stayed at a smaller and quieter place the following night, only 10-15' away from Toulouse, and was very glad to have done so.\n\nThe camping grounds aren't too bad, but aren't great either (no hedges or separation between spots, very few trees, etc.). The toilets and showers ARE very nice though (indoor plants and everything), and were very clean (and heated!).\n\nThe staff, it must be said, were very friendly and helpful, in my experience, and didn't give us any problems for arriving later than the usual reception closing time. \n\nAll in all, it's not bad if you don't mind the noise and like being close to the city. If you're more of the quiet, amidst-nature type of person, I'd go for something else. There are a few other options not too far away, which are much more pleasant (and cheaper too!). ",
      "Il campeggio non sarebbe malissimo, se non fosse per il mega accampamento nomadi all'esterno! Filo spinato e telecamere ovunque!! Non molto rilassante. Personale alla reception molto cordiale. Per il resto il campeggio discreto.",
      "Camping con molti stanziali. A noi è stata assegnata una piazzola vicino a gente (non turisti) che hanno bevuto, cantato e parlato fino a quando non è arrivato il gestore che è stato gentile e premuroso. Purtroppo la nostra piazzola era cosparsa di cacche di cane un po' ovunque. L' accesso al campeggio non è facile. "

Very comfortable.\nHowever...\nThe whole stay ruined by the officious owner on departure. We wanted to take on water - about 25 litres. This was denied! \"Water is for campers only, not for you in a motor home\" despite us paying more to stay. He suggested we should drive 25km to nearest Aire to take on water !\nAvoid - go somewhere you will be welcome ",

The owners give you a warm welcome and ar always helpfull and available. Worth five stars! We will come again!",

Nos enfants étaient sur leurs vélos entrain de nous attendre près des sanitaires, elle leur a littéralement crié dessus. Quand nous sommes arrivés et que nous avons demandé des explications, pas un bonsoir, peu d'explications et très antipathique.... On a vite compris que ce camping joui de sa situation, et que les services et accueil passent très loin derrière. Nous avons vite regretté le petit camping municipal de la veille. Notre séjour de 5 jours c'est écourté à la nuit, car 26 € /nuit pour ça....désolée je passe mon chemin et tant pis pour la vue !\nBref 1 étoile juste pour la situation et l'emplacement."

      "Super camping, friendly man at the reception. Came in late, on the bike, called the intercom and he came in 2 minutes. Good pitches, separated by small bushes, Wi-Fi available at the reception, but you might get lucky to get a pitch close that can still reach the network. \n\nClean sanitaires, laundry machine and dryer in the same building, also sinks for washing dishes. No toilet paper in the bathroom, no soap in the lavatories, but you kinda get used to these in many campings. \n\nIt was closed now (September) but there is also a pool and many other outdoor recreational areas. \n\nElectricity plugs in the bathroom (French plug) and in the bushes that separate the pitches (blue CEE plug) - you might have to search a bit in the bush, but it's there. \n\nReally pleased with my stay here! I could stay in the evening at the table outside the reception to work online (there is electricity there also)",

Right next to the river it is overlooked by a medieval town, beautiful. Campsite is good, I can't review for an extended stay. Toilet & shower block are all new, good very clean and free. The small shop also serves wine & beer. I didn't need more. There is a security fence all around the site which should give parents some peace of mind.",
      "I was looking for a nice camping for one week, this one seemed okay when we stayed here for one night a while ago. I knew I will arrive late, so called to make a reservation. On the phone I was advised to book online, so I did. Booked a place online, had to pay the full amount, arrived at 9 in the evening, the staff was busy with the cafe, so I waited patiently until they had time for me. When one of the employees had time hi immediately started with upbraid that it was late and he is busy. My argument about the fact that I booked a spot didn't make any difference. When hi showed us a spot I was in doubt about the possibility to fit there two tents and a car, beside the fact that there was no electricity at that spot. The employee immediately started seeking attention from the people around and telling them that I wanted the whole field for me only and that I didn't like the people around. Then hi showed us another spot and while showing he keep saying very sarcastic: \"I hope this is good enough for you, because this is nearby the toilets\".  This spot is not even a separate place, this is some space between two caravans. We use this night one tent and will leave tomorrow morning. This camping will never see me again here. If you think that if you book, pay and receive a confirmation - then you have a certainty about the promised stuff, don't book here. ",
      "Spacious campsite with plenty of trees to seek the shade. Near the entrance there's a little cafe with friendly and optimistic staff. Bread can be ordered for the morning but the quality was lower than expected. You're better off visiting the local bakery.",
      "Great place!\n\n- we enjoyed the service\n- the washing rooms are new (2017) and get cleaned several times every day\n- the owners are welcoming and kind people\n- the location just at the river is awesome!\n- bicycles rentable for 6€ / day\n- Liverdun is a nice city, Toul and Nancy are reachable by bicycle\n- reachable by train\n- pool, volleyball field and table tennis usable for free\n\nYou can hear a train several times a day, but we didn't find it disturbing."

Rotsige grond. \n\nSanitair is matig zowel van kwaliteit als van verzorgdheid. Het restaurantje op de camping biedt slechts flammkuchen en patat met hamburgers voor een flinke prijs. Ontbijt was helemaal geen aanrader: kan koffie, homp stokbrood en een pot jam. C'est ca.\n\nPrima voor een (paar) nachtje(s).",
      "Dommage que les sanitaires de ce camping soient très sales avec des portes manteaux cassées, des lunettes de toilettes cassées, des toiles d'araignées en pagaille dans la buanderie, dans les toilettes ... Cela n'est pas admissible dans une région touristique comme les Vosges. On sent que la propreté n'est pas la priorité.\nDommage car le camping en lui même est agréable et l'accueil sympathique.",
      "Camping agréable et bien situé pour visiter Colmar, Munster et la route des crêtes. dommage que les sanitaires soient si sales et vétustes. Il suffirait d'un entretien un peu plus soigneux pour qu'il surpasse les autres campings du coin.\nL'eau chaude est rare, voir inexistante aux heures de pointe. plusieurs générations d'araignées se côtoient dans les coins de mur, les encadrements de portes pourrissent sur place, et des fils électriques pendent dans les sanitaires.\nBref un camping sympathique mais à l'abandon."

Die Duschen sind sehr gut (Regendusche von oben in Verbindung mit Handbrause). Leider gibt es keine Möglichkeit direkt am Platz Dinge des täglichen Bedarfs einzukaufen. Der junge Mitarbeiter ist sehr engagiert, erklärt nicht nur Wissenswertes zum Platz, sondern gibt auch Empfehlungen zu Wanderwegen bzw. Radtouren.",

Sometimes, the showers aren't warm. You can watch tv, drink a beer, eat a crêpe and do some groceries near the reception. Personnel is friendly.",
      "Fantastic little place. Beautiful. Friendly staff, good prices, and little shop with bread milk etc and fresh baguettes and quassionts every morning. Really reccomend. Such a fabulous location and well kept site!!",
      "A great camping! Its location next to the Lac de Longemer is beautiful, with plenty of oppurtunity to walk in the vicinity of the camping without having to get in the car. The pitches are large, the staff at the reception and camping shop is friendly and is proficient in English (I've also heard some speak German). On some evenings they have some (musical) entertainment near the bar, but they stop before midnight and usually have music that's no problem to have on the background.\n\nThe toilets (they have more normal toilets than the strange French ones) and showers are clean and warm (if you shower between 08h00 and 22h00). There's water taps every few pitches.\n\nThe shop is expensive, but (I believe) more caters towards guests who forgot to buy something when they were in town and find the other shops closed. There's a supermarché on about 10 minutes driving (in Gerardmer) and, if you need it, a Decathlon on about 40 minutes (in Saint-Dié).\n\nYou can swim in the lake, and if you need suggestions for walking you can try to see if they still have the walking booklet Le Guide Rando by Hervé Thro at the reception. It's in French (so some Google Translate may be required), but it has some nice challenging hikes that are fun even for casual hikers that usually only walk flat routes.",
      "Beautiful location. Friendly staff. Good prices. Doesn't get 5 stars as facilities are a little dated but if you can see past that a great place to stay.",
      "Les sanitaires sont correct mais souvent un peu inondés. Les douches sont froides. \nLa boutique est pratique mais très chère, le snack est constitué de produit surgelés/congelés réchauffés qui sont servis dans un temps d'attente extrêmement long à un prix beaucoup trop élevé selon moi. \nLe cadre du camping est sympathique, on peut se baigner facilement.

      "The staff were very freindly and helpfull.... we stayed in a cabin and it was the cleanest place i have ever stayed. the park was also neat and tidy and plenty of space for travellers. The only issue we had was that the bed was uncomfortable and sqeeked every time we moved..",
      "Travel from Horbat to Launcheston by motorhome for a week ,i can say that the staff here is the most friendly and helpful.The place is clean too.I will highly recommend this place and give 5*.",
      "Absolutely the most friendliest park management I've encountered yet. It was a nice touch to be shown directly to your spot in the park rather than the usual 'follow the map' method!\nThis may not be a big flashy park as far as facilities go, but that which is provided is very well maintained. \nWe will definitely stay again!"

It was a strange concept as in our travels I have never found a coin operated hot water system. The care takers at the site were friendly and can change notes into 20c peices for the showers.",
      "Wonderful campground - sound of the creek, chickens roaming, very clean showers with much-loved scalding hot high-pressure water (0.60$/5min), firewood provided, well-equipped kitchen, and a very very kind and warm caretaker. Only thing is would have appreciated a light in the bathroom but otherwise great place",
      "Relatively cheap. The creek next to the campground is excellent for platypus watching. We saw platypus on two occasions during the two days we were there. ",
      "Quaint little caravan park, ideal camping spot beside the river. \nJill was very friendly and helpful too. \nWill definitely recommend. ",
      "This is a simple, pretty, friendly and low-cost caravan park. Most of the unpowered sites are along a creek, which is lovely. The camp kitchen is a three-walled shed, with a kettle, electric hotplates, a BBQ and cold running water. There are fire pots with free firewood. My only complaint is that traffic on the nearby highway woke me up each morning."

The kids 7 and 9 loved the creek and looking for critters in the rock pools as well as the water fall walk. \nWe've made a few friends in our short stay.  \nWe had a 2 story cabin and we're surprised at the value and what we got! \nThe playground was something out of a locals back yard which was refreshing... i am sick of the same old same old... but for some... might be a bit off.  If the kids have bikes and a net to catch small fish PACK THEM!\n\nWould recommend staying there for a week minimum as our 2 night stay was way to short. ",
      "We went their as a walk in (Family of four)...... Fantastic helpful staff found us a Cabin and wished we had gone their sooner on our trip to Tassie. grounds are shady and almost tropical and the creek is crystal clear and great for swimming. Take Bikes, fishing gear and all your essentials with you as shops are a fair drive. (well stocked Kiosk)",
      "Fantastic location 20 ;minutes from Stanley and a short drive to the Tarkine and West Coast Wilderness Way. Don't expect luxurious accommodation but the cabins although a bit dated, are clean and comfortable.and we enjoyed a two night stay in a 3 bedroom cabin. Staff are friendly and helpful.",

      "Most of the “camps” in Wadi Rum listed on the Internet (TripAdvisor, Routard, etc.) don’t actually exist. Their “owners” together with the help of their girlfriends, who write and speak good English, create a fake website and post a lot of self-promoting reviews in order to attract naive tourists. As a result, travellers find themselves in trouble and get scammed.\n\nThat is why, before going to Wadi Rum, insist the desert camps on sending you a scanned copy of their license, as 99.9% of them don’t have one.\n\nHave this in mind before booking any tour, and don’t let Bedouins fool you with fake reviews and nemorous self-compliments."

      "it's a good place but it's not clean, that's why I hated it, when I came back from outside I spent the night cleaning my room because I found cockroaches all over the room, it might be from the bathroom, I don't know! \nthe staff were very cool and kind. They only should take more care of cleanliness and fixing the furniture or renew it, then it'll an amazing place.",
      "Great place to crash. Nice view, decent rooms.  Very good vibes there. Perfect chill location. Found the place last minute, very good price. The diving instructor Ricardo made my 1st scuba dive an amazing time!!",
      "Really friendly and helpful staff. Great value for money, right next to the south beach (out of the city but a nice quiet location). Direct acess to the coral reef for snorkling and scuba diving. The room was basic but clean with working air con. There is a great view of the sunset from the terrace. \n\nThe hotel has its own dive centre and dive sites are within walking distance (you can walk with full scuba gear for a shore dive). The dive instructor was very friendly\n\nBe aware this hotel is 12 km from Aqaba with a limited and basic menu-therfore if you dont have a car you will have to take taxis into town for better food options.",
      "The pool was not available for two days and the manager has no communication skills at all. ",
      "Jordan in general was like a warm bath. Very friendly and hospitable people. It takes merely one nice word to get a warm welcome and a big smile back. Taxi drivers apologizing for offering us a ride while we had a rental car, snackbar cashiers giving us free bottles of water because we gave a small tip, coffee on the house because we said something how splendid our Jordan experience had been so far. Also, what struck me very often is that besides being very friendly and hospitable, Jordan's have a very nice sense of humor. We had quit some laughs and fooling around with a lot of people. In order to get a friendly face it only takes being respectful and friendly yourself.\nDarna Village staff was no exception with regards to this all. We did not stay in the hotel itself, but we had dinner in the restaurant a couple of times. The food was delicious and the brothers who run the hotel took a lot of time to make sure we were comfortable and satisfied. We went on a dive tour with our family of five as well. We all enjoyed it very much, including our youngest of 11. They took us to a nearby spot. You simply walk into the water and in no time you are surrounded by a most fantastic scenery with colorful tropical fish and coral. The hotel itself is next to the beach. The coral reef is just a footstep into the water. The beach is nice and the water calm and warm. We had a rental car. Great to drive to Aqaba, Petra and Wadi Rum. Aqaba is merely a 10-15 minute drive. Petra was something like 2 hours drive and Wadi Rum 1 hour."

      "We visited the camp in February 2016 for one night and a day tour. We met some of the most friendly people here. Even though it was off season for tourists, they've organized everything for only the two of us. We were basically alone in the camp. The owner is really friendly, helpful and flexible.\nOne of the best experiences I had so far. Highly recommend this camp.",
      "Mehedi tailored me a three day trip that had all I wanted: a camel trek, doing the Burdah arch and bivouacking out in the desert.\nIbrahim, my camel guide, did a great job to teach me the fundamentals of how to get a camel to do what I wanted - with some success! He is a knowledgeable, personable and interesting chap who made the 4 hour trip from the village to the camp a very interesting time.\nThe camp is in a hidden, secluded opening in a narrow canyon and has been built to resemble a Bedouin settlement. You'll sleep in simple, but very comfortable little 'tent' compartments with plenty of warm cover for the cold nights. Food is taken in the communal dining tent - and is tasty, plentiful and in the Bedouin tradition. I slept like a log in total comfort.\nSalah took me up to the Burdah Arch next morning - nice scrambling, breath-taking scenery and mind-blowing views at the top. After a leisurely lunch (and lots of the additive Bedouin tea!) up on the mountain he put me on a foot march through the desert and after meeting at Lawrence's house found a deserted and secluded place for the bivouac. The Bedouin stew he cooked on an open fire was tasty - and how he baked bread over an open fire and using the hot embers to get both sides crunchy was quite amazing. In Bedouin style the bread then gets broken up and mixed with the stew, so that you can roll it and eat it by hand - which took a bit of practice! \nSleeping out in the open under the stars was something I had wanted to do for a while - and it was just as phenomenal and liberating as I always thought it would be. \nSalah's expert guiding and his easy manner made him a great companion.\nAll in all, what I really liked about Mehdi's operation was the genuine, no false frills approach to making you have a great time among what felt like new friends. I couldn't recommend him more to anybody who is after a great experience, expertly delivered.",
      "I visited Bedouin Directions in November 2013 and stayed 3 nights at the camp with my best pal, both of us seeking a quiet beautiful place, in undeveloped pristine desert for us to explore and enjoy while catching up. We couldn't have been more thrilled with this place. The guys at the camp were Bedouin who clearly loved and knew their beautiful desert. We walked out of the camp each day for an un-guided walk about and saw some of the most incredible desert-scapes we've ever seen. By night we enjoyed the provided cooked meal as well as a communal experience with the guys playing music (singing, clapping & oud) as well as fun Bedouin games with them and the other guests. The whole experience is one i will remember dearly forever. I highly recommend Bedouin Directions for those interested in having a unique cultural experience while making accessible incredible desert wilderness.",

Just a few meters away from the main highway it really cuts you off from the regular life and gives you the taste of wild.

      "The places is still virgin which makes it serene and peaceful. I want to keep it a secret from others but the words has to be said for its beauty. One of the best kept secret of Himalayas. ",
      "awesome experience of trekking and river crossing.superb service and bird watching .it is a great comapany!!!!best in valley",
      "The first time I visited Tirthan valley was in March 2016 for a trek to rangthar, followed by another trek to Rolla...and since the first time have visited 5 times in the past 15 months....Do I need to say more? Well I don't if I wish to give a 5 star rating...\nBut I do need to write more as I wish to give not 5 but 6 stars....\n5 ofcourse for the incomparable, raw natural beauty....the sparkling, effervescent waters of the river Tirthan, the breath taking views of snow clad Himalayas, the walks & treks to and through the pristine Great Himalayan National Park and the total absence of commercialization with only homestays and home run guesthouses for accommodation.\nBut that additional sixth star and perhaps the most important one which has got us back again and again and again is for the way you are made to feel at home in this paradise by the outstanding team of sunshine adventures. The promoters of sunshine - Panki and Ankit...both brothers... Who beyond holding a long list of achievements and contributions in the field of mountaineering and ecotourism are extremely warm individuals giving personal attention to every guest who visits their home..the valley.\nAnd this same warmth passes on to their team who takes care of the guests like no other even on treks, during worst of weather with the limited resources they carry along. I would always remember that time when it was raining hailstones during our rangthar trek and we were confined to our tents and someone called from outside....madam tent kholo chai aur pakode banaaye Hai!!!That truly floored us!! And the best part is this wasn't a one time affair...coz have experienced the same across my 5 visits. Panki and Ankit....you truly are Sunshine brothers for the way you and your  team spreads sunshine in lives of all who visit your valley! Thanks a ton! All the best....and I am sure I will be back soon!! So although there isn't an option to give here....here come my 6 stars!!",
      "We had a great trip with this ecotour operator ..Valley is amazingly beautiful.\nMust visit in winters .",
      "There is a lot to say but I will try to confine myself in few words.\n\nMy journey to Great Himalayan National Park(UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITE) was an experience of a lifetime. It was a spiritual journey carried out physically through rappelling, river crossing and trekking to Shilt peak (10000 feet).\n\nPersonally, in last 1 - 1.5kms of trekking, it felt like a test of physical strength, endurance, stamina and mental calmness. I was able to explore myself and discover new horizons.\n\nWe camped at Rolla camp, danced around Bonfire and able to connect with nature. The beauty of the landscape was mesmerizing.\n\nMoreover, I had firsthand experience of SHGs who prepared local cuisine such as DHAAM and SIDDU for us.\n\nI was lucky enough to meet Mr Panki Sood (featured in National Geographic Magazine, adventures, mountaineer, writer, nature photographer, Ecotourism company owner and above all a wonderful person) and Mr Ankit Sood (Phd., working on project sponsored by ADB to promote ecotourism and much more) and Sunshine Himalayan Adventures.... and others who made this trip as a memorable experience.\n\n..... I feel like going again.....\n"

Vervelen , in de carvan blijven , beetje naar de speeltuin , zo hoort een vakantie niet te zijn op de hoek bin ons huis heb je ook een speeltuin , het zwembad is gesloten stond niet online. Hengelhof zwembad 35 km rijden maar kinderne willen elke dag zwemmen wanneer ze willen niet 1 x in de week dat we daar waren , zeer saai ben echt teleurgesteld aangezien onze kids 4/5/3 zijn en zr kunnen ook niet golfen , geen bingo , helemaal niks . En de kinderen waren ziek dus we moesten eerder vertrekken , we waren met neven en nichten en hun lwamen terug met luizen wss door slechte hygiene van de bedden en caravans , super teleurgesteld zo hoort vakantie niet te zijn we komen terug met van alles behalve goeie herrineringen ...",

      "This is a really nice campsite. We loved the large pitches under the trees and it was really nice to have the pitch surrounded by lovely hedging.\n\nThe owners could not have been more welcoming and the whole site has a pleasant feel about the place. The sanitary blocks were dated but spotless and seemed to always be being cleaned.\n\nThe pool area was fantastic and the bar area was good too. Our kids certainly enjoyed the campsite and reckoned it was probably their joint favourite of the 6 we visited.\n\nThe surrounding town of Bocholt is actually really nice and there are plenty of cycling routes around and it really is a nice countryside.\n\nA couple of suggestions for the owners (thinking about it afterwards on the long drive home) would be to:\n\n1. Have the tennis courts free to guests, by all means guests would have to rent the equipment if they didn't have their own\n2. Same with the crazy golf, free for guests who have their own equipment\n3. Clean the sanitary blocks a little less!\n\nI did think the cost per night was a little high (by €15 or so) and I do appreciate we were staying in the luxury pitch so cheaper options were available but for the 3 nights we were there we justified it.\n\nHope to make it back here some day ...",

      "Forventningerne og markedsføringen af campingpladsen var skruet for højt op. Vi blev skuffet over mange ting. Brugerbetaling af diverse var irriterende. \nI badeland fik vi besked på at betale(køre kort igennem) for en 13 måneder baby som var på armen af mor da de var inde og se 10min mens børnene/far bader. Det er helt uhørt.\nDet er ikke en dårlig campingplads, men i forhold til markedsføringen og dermed forventningerne, så bliver man nok skuffet. Et eksempel: \"Danmarks største badeland på en campingplads med 10 vandruchebaner\". Jeg har været på mindst 2 andre campingpladser i DK med større badeland. Jeg kan også godt tælle 10 vandruchebaner, ikke som forventet!",
      "Groß, Animation, nur kurzer Weg zum (schönen) Strand. Vorwiegend Familien mit Kindern (Hauptsaison). Warmes Wasser (Duschen, Abwaschen) kostet jedes Mal extra. Gutes WLAN für ca. 10€/Woche.\nFür meinen Geschmack etwas zu groß und touristisch.",
      "Var her for noen år siden. Flott campingplass! Store og fine plasser, med hekk rundt mange av plassene, så man er litt mer skjermet. Sanitæranlegg var veldig bra, også godt vasket til enhver tid. Flott basengområde både inne og ute.  Eneste som jeg har og trekke ned på var maten på Restauranten på plassen, biffen var veldig seig og synes man fikk lite mat. Men mulig dette er bedre nå. Lekeplassen var også fantastisk, Fin plass for både store og små"

They offer WI-FI at a rate for a few hours and even charged me a few krones for storing my freezing elements.",

      "Es el peor camping que he visto, no lo aconsejo para nadie está lejos del mundo no hay cobertura y las llamadas te las cobran.  Los árboles no están cuidados y cada vez que tienes que aparcar es una lucha con los arbustos. Los baños son pesimos hay telarañas, en las duchas parece que te vaya a salir de ahí una cucaracha, y el jabón está puesto en una botella de agua vacía.\n La lavanderia esta a la otra parte del camping, en definitiva se nota que no está cuidado.\nEn cambio enfrente de este mismo \"camping\" si se puede llamar así hay otro que parecen mucho mejor, con piscina y se nota que hay ambiente.\nEn mi caso fuimos con autocaravana  y la sorpresa fue que al llegar no había para poder cambiar aguas!! Creo que es algo importante y deberían haber informado, para eso me voy a las afueras de un pueblo y aparco ahí.\nEn el  Folleto pone que la tienda está abierta y es mentira, en ningún momento  la vimos  abierta.\nPor cierto!  Si vais a Galicia os recomiendo el camping Santa Tecla, que está  justo  al lado  del río  Miño.\n",

Los cubos de basura no tienen tapa por lo que en verano el olor y las moscas son bastante desagradables. Los perros andan sueltos por el camping por lo que proliferan las defecaciones de los mismos y asustan a los niños cuando salen tranquilamente a los caminos . Y aunque la responsabilidad de los excrementos de los perros es también de los dueños el máximo responsable es el camping ya que  los perros deben estar atados y la dirección debe obligar a los dueños a cumplir esta ley.  La megafonía no funciona con lo cual es imposible dar avisos. En fín un camping a la que la segunda categoría se la han regalado.",

A spacious well-equipped site, with restaurant, swimming pool, lots of children's play equipment. Like a Holiday Club site, really. \nHowever it's so big that I had no trouble finding a quiet spot under some trees. And appreciated all that it offered. \nThe evening  brought a really good well-priced meal in the restaurant, and a walk along the river underneath the site. Magical!",

      "stayed there last year (2013) in our motor caravan. very good site. extremely helpful Manager. Speaks excellent English. told us how and where to get the bus to Limoges.\n\nIf you go here do not miss out on a visit to Oradour-Sur-Glane destroyed by the Nazis in 1946.  so sad so memorable\n",

Pero...hay cosas que chirrían, los precios tan altos o cosas como por ejemplo los guardas de seguridad. Si te ven que eres menor de edad, se creen que pueden hablarte como quieren y eso no es así. Los niños y adolescentes también se merecen un respeto. Hay dos guardas en especial que se comportan así, y aunque ellos sean mas mayores, no tienen por qué merecer más respeto si ellos no respetan. Yo solo  digo que sería una cosa necesaria de mejorar.",

Talvez pelo elevado número de utilizadores.\nTerreno duro para tendas.\nAs vespas (picaram-me... Malandras!)\n",

Lo único que no he probado es el restaurante, así que no puedo opinar. Repetiré seguro."

      "Heerlijke rustige goedkope camping. Gezellige grappige lieve Haagse eigenaar (muzikant, creatief en vrijbuiter) die momenteel door omstandigheden de camping in zijn eentje draait (en ook nog kookt bv!!). Dat is natuurlijk veel te veel en dat zie je wel een beetje, maar aan de andere kant zal t ook nooit een typische ANWB camping worden en dat wil hij ook niet. Hier kom je voor de rust en de eenvoud en omdat je juist ver wilt blijven van toeters en bellen. Of juist voor de muziek want hij heeft buiten en binnen instrumenten staan waar hij het liefs elke avond een bandje mee zou willen laten spelen. De kampeerplaatsen zijn dan ook bewust vrij ver vd ingang, receptie en cafeetje/restaurantje zodat kampeerders geen last hebben als er weer muziek gemaakt wordt. Als je verder absolute stilte wilt, gecombineerd met een gezellig kletsende beetje alternatieve campingeigenaar en als je een klein budget hebt, dan is dit de perfecte plek.",

Set in a pine forest there is lots of shade and the facilities were very clean and well maintained, pool was excellent and the staff were friendly, helpful and fun. We have camped a lot through Spain and this is most definitely one of the better ones. We'll be back.  ",

Buen sitio para que los niños puedan estar a su aire y la animadora Raquel encantadora con ellos y no dejan de jugar y todas las semanas cine de verano. Por la noche se agradece tener que estar de largo y el silencio nocturno es muy bueno, de lo mejor. Los baños siempre los encontré limpios pero son antiguos, deberían reformarlos. Muchas rutas sencillas por pistas forestales para poder ir con los niños con las bicis o paseando hasta el pueblo por ejemplo. Muy tranquilo y por la cercanía a Madrid seguro repetimos",

Plaatsen erg groot en naar keuze helemaal schaduw of half schaduw of zon. Ook afwaswater lekker warm. Zeer grote staanplaatsen. Grote vrije velden om te spelen. In avond vroeg stil. 6 mobiel homes aan rand camping. 2 sanitair gebouwen. Op 10 minuten lopen van gezellig plaatsje. Alle supermarkten aanwezig. ",
      "Mooie rustige camping op loopafstand van de plaats Junien.  Het sanitaire wordt iedere dag gepoetst en ziet er ook schoon uit. De camping beheerder is zeer vriendelijk. Deze camping heeft ook alle faciliteiten voor campers. Wij stonden hier in juli 2017 en waren zeer tevreden. Zeker een aanrader.",

Varen onder de 18 jaar is alleen toegestaan met een volwassene...\nBij Kanoën is een zwemvest verplicht...\nOja ..dr stond nog een4  opmerking over vervuild water met uranium van de oude mijn hier, die kun je negeren het meer is in 10 maanden tijd helemaal leeggehaald en afgegraven en dus schoongemaakt...\nHoi je van wandelen? Kun je hier in de omgeving leuke routes lopen...",
      "Couple qui gère le camping sympa. Au bord du lac. Château gonflable apprécié par les enfants. \n\nDes moins ? Piscine un peu petit, les douches pas toujours chaud, les éviers pour faire le vaisselle fuites, et seulement une Bloc de sanitaires/douche ouvert pour tout le monde ....  Des branches mortes dans les arbres m'ont inquiétez en cas d'orage ou ventes.\n\nSinon une camping calme et plaisante. La boulangerie à Saint Pardoux excellente !!!

We were very impressed with the clever use of such a small space. Didn't feel cramped at all, and appreciated a comfortable seat during the day which turned into a proper bed in the evening. Totally worth having somewhere with a kitchen and an en suite for our weekend away. Our 11 month old had a great time too!",

Friendly welcome guide given to plot plug in relax. Hot shower in the toilet block that is kept clean. Good washing up and washing facilities. Good area for wildlife. Walk to bus stop a bit longer than we thought but regular buses. The walk to the bus stop was broke up by some friendly cattle on way. Recommended.",

It's a couple that runs the place, the woman knows a lot about the walks you can do in the area and the man knows a lot about the town and the restaurants. The site even when fully booked feels really relaxed and quiet which is to our liking. There's a lounge/information area you can use to read and be warm when it's rainy and you are with a tent, also you can charge your devices. Laundry is 70p and you can get freshly baked bread and croissants from a local bakery on a daily fashion. ",

It's all thought out:   adult camp area, ready-made glamping tents, family camping, compost loos, den area, pond, rainy day hut, more plans in the pipeline , wildflower flower galore and stunning countryside all around.",

Bathrooms are clean and look new but again built to be cheap. Apart from the shower cabins, there are no separators for washers or anything else. Best part is that there are no hair dryers. If you want a hair dryer you need to go all the way to reception and leave £5 deposit for it... because of course you always carry cash with you to the bathroom. ",
      "Superb community run campsite. Excellent clean facilities. Campsite is 'open-plan' so if you want privacy this place is not for you but we loved it. There is about 6 metres of grass between motorhome pitches so it doesn't feel hemmed in. Camping for tents is on a grassy area so you get cosy with your neighbour but we like company so no problem for  us. We found it very quiet overnight.  ",
      "Very nice place, excellent facilities only possible criticism would be lack of shade in the tent area, could be very hot midsummer but as the park was completely washed away last year and still has some areas yet to be reconstructed perhaps some trees and hedging are in the future plans, they have done a great job so far.",

The touring pitches which are adjacent to the river can be soft for motorhomes after heavy rain and there is a risk of flooding on occasion. The female shower/toilets and laundry room are excellent, however, the male block while adequate is in need of renovation.",

Price was excellent (1 night stay). I couldn't recommend this place enough to anyone looking for an undisturbed and serene camp. I would recommend dropping into the Coach Road Inn down the road, Mags was a great host for the whole night we spent there!  Will be back in the near future. Thanks again",

The same applies to the kitchen, the water was piping hot with new fridge and cooker. If only all campsites in Ireland could be this good!\nStaff and owners were also very welcoming  and knowledgeable about the area. \nThey also have accommodation (lodges and a winter chalet) suitable for when the weather gets colder. \nPlus the pub is within walking distance! As are walks and bicycle trails, and glorious scenery. \nJust book it...",

The games room on 2 nights from 7pm on was full of adults and teenagers drinking and groups outside it smoking, my 8 + 10 yr old was not let kick a football to each other even in the grass area, there was absolutely nothing to do there . our children we intimidated by other children on site (staff did try on a number of occasions to ask them children to behave but it didn't happen) We booked for 8 nights but would have gladly gone home on the 4th only for we paid so much for the full stay.  this really is only a place to sleep not for a family holiday looking for entertainment.",

There was plenty of room to pitch my tent of it large size. \nWhen I can back there was an older man there and he very rudely they we won't take a tent of that size. I proceed to say that there was plant of room to pitch it. He answered me you expect to come in here and pay the same price as a small tent would. I then said I would be willing to pay more then if it was that much of an issue and if I would be able to pitch over there as I pointed to a large green area behind some caravans. He very rudely said back not a chance there expense caravans I would not put a tent in there...

      "An amazing centre with amazing staff. The staff are the friendliest people I know and couldn't have more respect for everyone that walk through there doors. I took an interest in owls and Sam (the falconer) provided me with an apprenticeship here and tons of information on birds. Kayleigh helped me a lot to learn about reptiles and helped me a lot with studies. These two lady's became my friends and helped me so much, with confidence, support, and my studies at college. Words can't describe how amazing and how grateful I am for there survives. Visits this wonderful centre and I promise you will experience one of the best and most educational day of your life.",
      "Went for a week and thankfully stayed in a camper van as a friend of ours stayed in a house for 3 and it was a kip the living area was very poor and the window in the bedroom was all mold and just filthy.  The pool area was very packed at times. the go karts and activities were a rip off as it is seven euro a go for five minutes on the go karts. Also to Finnish the holiday my friend phone was was stole. I would recommend that as a day trip as lots of things to do for kids but would strongly advise no one to rent one of the houses for the reasons above.",
      "Loved it. Kids had an amazing time. Accommodation was good and not like some of the reviews suggested. Stayed from a Friday to a Sunday but will book a week for next year. ",
      "It's a really good place for both adults and children. I recommend it in the summer as a lot of the activities are outdoors. My favourite activity is the swimming!\n",
      "Have come twice now and we have been happy with our family holiday. With 4 small children it can be a challenge keeping everyone happy but thanks to the variety of activities we have no issues at Trabolgan. Nights can be noisey with kiddies running everywhere but the children are on holiday so why not stay up late and have fun"

We were very lucky with the weather, but the comfort of the yurts and the warm welcome we received from Colleen and Fabrizio would have made this a wonderful stay anyway.  I highly recommend Inch Hideaway as an escape from the chaos of everyday life.  It's a calm, serene and naturally beautiful place to kick-back and relax.",
      "A very unique experience.  We weren't sure what to expect, but the yurts were spacious, warm and cozy.  Cute little community kitchen and the hosts were lovely.  Composting toilets were a new experience, but not horrible, and glad to have an instant hot water shower, although it is a bit difficult to leave the warm water!",

Overflow is an open field. Lots of play areas and the jumping pillow (jump on it like a trampoline) is a giant bouncy air bag, it's very popular and seems safer than a trampoline. The on site store has fair prices; and there's a decent schedule for entertainment including crafts, performances, hay rides, etc. Honestly the petting zoo could use attention, and nothing is actually pet-able.",

We are tenters so site management and bathrooms are very important to us and we loved both! We noticed the bathrooms were ultra clean and newly renovated which was the cherry on top. The staff are incredibly kind and helpful and the lady at the security station was hands down the nicest lady we've ever met! We will be back summer after summer to our new favourite place to camp!

The only complaint I have is that the BBQ was not very clean, the grills we're ok but when we started the BBQ the entire inside caught on fire because it was so full. Other than that it was an amazing stay and I will definitely be staying there again.",

Incredibly \"outdated\" accommodations. Also falsely advertised a \"full size \" fridge.....well the fridge was a \"mini\" fridge - and when asked they said they could do nothing about it. So consequently much of our food that we brought went bad/wasted .... unacceptable. On checking out, the staff were downright rude actually. You would think with the kind \"room rate\" charged they could at least be more pleasant - otherwise don't let people stay at your establishment during the Cavendish Music festival.",

The security guard was very very unprofessional, rude and ignorant, I could go on but with that said I will NEVER camp at White sand cottages again."

      "Very nice and well maintained campground.  It's WAY TOO BUSY for my taste but you can't blame a business for being good at attracting customers.  Kids on bikes go in every direction and you are quite certain most of the time that one or more of them are going to run into the side of your car or truck.  Again, I give a five star rating as the campground is very nice and well run.  Many of the parents who are supervising their own children deserve a 1 star rating.  The campground does list a number of rules but it doesn't appear that they are enforced.  That's not a bad thing... they say no walking around with alcohol but one of the first things I saw was a guy walking around with his wine glass in one hand and the bottle in the other.  They say... everyone must wear a bike helmet when biking,  again...... maybe 10% of the bikers were wearing helmets.  Dogs on leach.... sometimes.....   Nobody wants the campground  to act as a police force I just wonder why they list so many rules, if they don't actually care.  The scenery in PEI is breath taking.  With the current exchange rate we found our American dollars went along way making this a very affordable camping experience.",
      "An easy way to camp. Bring your tents (or rent an RV) and have fun. A beautiful beach, a cafe, showers/bathrooms, a playground for the kids, and lots of space for them to ride their bikes. More glamping than camping and that's fine with me.",
      " Absolutely fantastic campground. Ultra clean, tons of activities. Local fishermen are there on weekends to sell fresh mussels, oysters, fish and lobster.

      "We just returned from a 9 night stay at Cymbria from Ontario.  It was a wonderful camping experience.  The grounds were very clean and the campsites were spacious and well maintained.  My kids loved the park and the pool and we found it very central to all the spots we wanted to visit.  The staff was so friendly and helpful and best of all the campground was quiet and so very relaxing.  We cannot wait to go back.  By far one of the best camping experiences we have had.",

      "Spacious, well kept campsites.  Central location on the island but off the beaten path.  Quiet and friendly.  So lovely, we extended our stay.",

The campground is extremely clean and very well groomed, along with sites that are larger than most on the Island.  These two fellows just couldn't do enough to make your stay one that would not be forgotten...we will be back.  Kudos to them...S & D",

The owners, Michael and Leonard are everything you could ask for and more, they are just so down to earth and helpful with everything.

      "AVOID\n\nWe stayed here for 2 nights on the back end of our maritime road trip. Had we known the reputation of this place we would have gone elsewhere. Unfortunately we had to learn from experience.\n\nThe campground itself is quite nice and wooded, although it is hard to find a site that isn't on a considerable slope for tenting. \n\nWashrooms are a bit gross. While the staff regularly comes by to clean them, all they really seem to do is empty the trash and sweep the floor. Some of the showers don't work.\n\nOn balance the campground location itself is fairly decent. Despite proximity to the disgusting tourist trap that is Cavendish Boardwalk, it's secluded and forested enough to be quite nice. \n\nThe office staff were helpful and pleasant.\n\nUnfortunately, whatever potential this campground has as a family-friendly site is totally ruined by the combination of people who have zero respect for others, coupled with completely ineffective noise regulation enforcement by the staff.\n\nAt the end of the day, if the sound of horrid metal music (plus drunken vocal accompaniment) and obscenely loud (and obviously fake) orgasms at 3:30 AM are not something you consider a part of a good camping experience, do yourself a favour and avoid this place.",

      "It's not bad. The staff are great and they have many activities to keep kids busy. As for camping it kinda sucks. There's no privacy as the sites are way too close together. And there are no trees to provide privacy between lots. On the other hand. You'll get to know your neighbors well since your practically on top of them! The playground works but it's comprised of mostly old steel structure that's rusty and one newish plastic structure  and of coarse the bouncy pillow which the kids like. The pool is nice. But I don't think I'll come back here.",
      "Campground was very well maintained and clean. Lots of areas to put your garbage and recyclables. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The Wagon ride was every day and it was really good. Kids really enjoyed the trail into the forest. will be definitely staying if another trip to Cavendish PEI is planned next year. Con's: banana bikes are expensive to rent $4.00 for half hour",
      "This is a very family oriented campground.  There are tons of things daily to keep children busy, wagon rides, scavenger hunts and movie nights all hosted by staff. Very friendly service in the store/gift shop. The only complaint I have is the shower houses arnt exactly convenient for everyone to access. If they added another shower house in the pool area it would be perfect. The lots are very spacious and clean. It was overall a pretty good experience.",

      "We spent three nights here in early August and had a great experience. The campsite was compact and lacking the privacy of some more heavily wooded sites, but was easily accessible and close to the beach. The staff was quite helpful and there were good facilities. However, one day the hot water heater broke and we had cold showers. Fire wood was available on site. ",
      "So disappointed.  Grass not cut. Sites are very small.  No garbage cans to be seen. Would not recommend it. Our provincial parks are so much better than the National parks.",
      "Beautiful, quiet campground across the street from the beach. New playground and washrooms (2 yrs old). Entry kiosk is brand new with lots of Parks Canada items for sale along with some of the usual camping supplies. This is a great place to relax. It's also with 20 minutes drive to Charlottetown and Cavendish. Bring your bikes - great paved bike path running the length of the park. Also, Robinson's Island offers a great mountain biking opportunity (or hike if you prefer). Enjoy",

      "Cripple Creek Campground\n\nWarning Owner is volatile and dangerous.  MOST DEFINITELY NOT ATV FRIENDLY.  ATV HOSTILE!!!\n\nOn Fathers Day, June 19, 2016 MYSELF AND MY COMPANION, BOTH 55 YEARS OLD, entered the Cripple Creek Campground on our quad, after a day of quading at Reynolds Ponds.  We wanted to actually see the facility and the sign on the road said \" snack shack now opened\" so we wanted food mostly. We obeyed the 10km sped limit and when we got into the campground we saw someone motioning to us to come to him.  So we did.\n\nBefore the owner Mike Touchette even got to us he was yelling no quads allowed and motioning for us to leave.  Did I mention he was drinking a beer? He came up and told us we were not allowed there.  We apologized and said we meant no harm we were just coming to eat.  He told us to go, NOW!  So we did, as I started to turn around I mentioned he wasn't very friendly.  He told me to stop that he wanted to talk to me.\n\nI said \"no, I don't want to talk to you, we are leaving like you told us to\".  And as I slowly, 10km, pulled away he hurled that full king can of beer at us, narrowly missing my wife.  He came running after me so I gunned it to get out before I was assaulted.  Looking behind I saw the owner going to his truck.  Like a crazed maniac he hunted us down eventually finding us on Dawson Road near the Double S lot.  Fearing that he would run us off the road I pulled the quad into the ditch and instructed my wife to call 911 immediately.\n\nThere was a confrontation on the side of the road that only settled down after I indicated to him the police were on the line and she was filming the incident.\n\nSo to be clear, Cripple Creek Campground does not want your business if you are an atv enthusiast.  Not even their restaurant.\n\nGood Luck with business venture, Mike Touchette.  Your name is mud in the Richer area.",

Although there are no hook ups, the pads are assaulted, the benches are solid surfaced and sites are clean. Can't wait to come again. If this is primitive, I'm in! Bring fishing poles and kayaks and bikes. Also you can have a campfire. Big plus!",

Water is only for hand washing and not advised to use for anything else as it cost a fortune for the campground and additional usage raises the price. Tent is not recommended unless setup and take down is done in the dark and early morning as the sun is blistering hot as soon as the sun rises!",
      "Very clean campsites and beyond friendly staff who were accommodating! We called later in the evening and knew nothing about the area, town of Williams or the campground. A person answered right away and was helpful and told us they'd stay open until we got there, which was after dark. We were greeted by not one but 4 very friendly hosts! Campsite was clean and a perfect size for our 4-man tent, with a clean fire pit that was super clean to cook on, and a great picnic table that looked to be wiped clean daily! Bathrooms close by were very clean. Only an hour to the Grand Canyon so it was convenient for us! Would stay again and recommend to friends!",

A few of the spaces can accommodate small to midsized RVs. Great hiking in the surrounding hills with lots of wildlife. Only negative is that the interior road is pretty rough, narrow and deeply rutted. ",

The best part is that it's free and the restroom is kept clean! Be advised that it's bear country there, so take proper precautions. For Cricket customers, you'll lose service about 1.5 miles before the campground fyi.",

During the summer is probably busier but I've never had a problem finding a spot. They have maybe about 10-15 free campgrounds available and a central restroom area that is usually clean as well. You are surrounded by the forest, hearing coyotes howling in the distance is a treat. This is definitely a respectable campground that is both clean and quiet, I hope it stays that way ! ",

I would have rated it higher except for the fact that the washrooms in the RV section are out of order and have been all season. It appears they may not be fixed for a long time. I heard a few campers express that they would rather use the campground washroom now and then rather than their RV washroom. I agree. I don't understand why it takes so long to get things fixed. Why cant the NFS get this fixed and/or at least get a portable toilet out there until they do? ",

      "I stayed there for nearly a month and a half (work related) and I was very happy with my experience. Sure the facilities maybe a little old but the staff there just took ownership and were working to upgrade the facilities. The staff were very nice and helpful, they kept the place clean and maintained. You have to remember that this is the closest campground to the city and that was the main reason for me staying there. The monthly rates were VERY reasonable considering the proximity and I would definitely recommend to anyone without hesitation. LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION and friendly staff makes this all worth it",
      "For me, facilities are the most important thing at a campground. The washrooms at the back are in need of some urgent maintenance. Showers are full of mould and mildew which is toxic and the stalls are so rusty they are ready to fall down. The laundry area could use some work as well  The staff was very friendly and the rest of the park appeared to be well maintained.",
      "The campground is nice and spacious. Accommodates a lot of campers. The bathrooms at the office were ok, but the bathrooms at the back closest to our site were gross. I have stayed in a lot of campgrounds, and expect things to get 'dirty' throughout a day,  but these were just gross. Black mold at the bottom, and what seemed to be months worth of soap grime on the tile. There was hardly any water pressure while showering.  I would look hard for somewhere else to go rather than stay here again.",

We had to pay extra for 2 of our children.  Never have to do that anywhere else if they are part of our family.  But we didn't argue.  The pool was very cold, almost unbearable.  Apparently there is a leak and instead of fixing it, they just add fresh water every other day. And the hot tub was also cool, not even warm.  The owner said she forgot to add wood to the boiler - how do you forget when you have hundreds of people paying to use this amenity?  If you're going to charge extra for additional people, make sure the amenities are actually functioning.  Very, very disappointed and will not be returning here!",

My only concern is that we needed a mechanic and the staff recommended Michael at Mobile Mechanics.  We contacted him and he told us he would be out t 4pm.  At 430 we finally called him and left a voicemail that never got returned.  Do NOT rely on the Mobile Mechanics as he does not show up and does not return phone calls.  What a loser!!! ",

A nice spot next to the creek- very flat, picnic table, stone fire ring and had a great fire there later too. It was around $45-50 with tax - clean simple bathrooms - no smells so that's good. \nI enjoyed my stay, friendly staff- would return",
      "Horrible customer service.  They lied about the sites available at the time we booked and stuck us at the very front.  We had 2 hoarders who live there year round next to us, a mosquito farm at our site due to the 'little creek' and were so far away we can't even utilize anything beyond the utilities.  I basically begged the 'manager' to please put us in any spot further in since there were so many EMPTY still (I should mention that they do not allow you to specify your spot but we have never had an issue).  He told me it was our fault for not planning better and was very condescending.  I consider myself pretty tough emotionally and they way he talked to me had me in tears.  We asked if we could cancel and were told that we would get none of our money refunded.\n\nWe have stayed here multiple times before and loved it.  I have never dealt with this man before today and after watching how polite he was to my husband I think he may have something against women.  I will be going out of my way to make sure everyone I know on social media is aware of this place and their shady 'policies'.  I want to also mention that when we've stayed here in the past we have been given the site location requested by showing up for check-in early; which we did again today.  \n\nNote: while I was standing in the office someone called to book for the weekend and they were told there was 'plenty of room' then the 'manager' replied 'we have several sites we can put them in'.  Surprise, they put them in a spot near we had asked to be!!\n\nSeriously, don't waste your time on these people and this place.  Lo-Lo Mai has lost a family of lifetime campers.

It is a bit expensive to stay here, but they've got FREE showers and a pool and hot tub.  Coin-op laundry.  There is also a swing set and playground area.  There is a family restroom area as well that provides a bit more privacy and containment.",
      "I loved this place! We have a pop up trailer and used a site with water and electricity hook ups. The site was beautiful and had tons of room and very nice scenery. We were very close to Oak Creek, it only took a minute to walk to. My kids loved being here since there was a heated pool and Jacuzzi as well as the playground. The bathrooms and showers are always clean and stocked. They even have little bbq grills you can borrow (at no fee) which came in handy. They sell firewood and have a little store on property , which pretty much has everything you could think of plus ice. This is a very convenient location since it is only 10-15 minutes away from Cottonwood and Sedona. Cottonwood has a 24hr Walmart which was needed during our stay.  I will definitely come back and recommend to everyone."

      "Layout of the sites is pretty nice. Location is close to town, obviously not overly tranquil despite the fields around the campground (especially since there was a new construction on one side going up). Kind of feels that someone cared about that place when it was built.\nbut not so much anymore! For an extra $5 you get water at your campsite that smells like sewage even if you let it run for 5 minutes (wonder how drinking water is tested in Steinbach to get away with it). Even the water at the sink in the washroom has a bad rust smell. The garbage bins in the washrooms were overflowing (and there were only a handful people on the ground). The wash and shower facilities haven't received any updates either; walls are stained and paint is flaking off, no shower curtains and cockroaches crawling in the showers.\nLimited number of camping tables; i.e. far less than the sites available, but I doubt that ever becomes a problem - who wants to stay there longer than just for a night anyway...",
      "We arrived to overflowing garbage at the garbage cans....the lawn needed cutting, but it had been raining...a week later it really needed cutting.....the road needs some fill as the mud puddles were horrific.....the worst was that a large group of tenters was in the campground for two nights...when they left the bathrooms had no toilet paper.....that's right, none of the bathrooms had the essentials...no toilet paper and no paper towels and the garbage cans were overflowing. We did not see any evidence of anyone coming to clean the facilities in the week we were there...\nThis is a very pretty sight and has great potential if only someone cared to provide some service  for the money paid to camp there.....\nIt is my understanding that the person who owns this is a realtor who wants to develop the property and does not have an interest in it's current commercial purpose.\nThe mayor of Steinbach should know what a bad mark this is putting on the quaint City of Steinbach..",
      "Very poorly maintained campground. Many of the picnic tables were unusable. There was NO hot water in the showers. Definately not worth $35 per night.",
      "I stayed there recently.  On the second night, I was warned that there was a big party planned for that night.  I called the number supplied for the campground.  The person I spoke with (Angie?) was neither sympathetic or helpful.  Very bad public relations - she obviously didn't care about my opinion or wellbeing.  The party went on, loudly, until about 3 AM.  Bad scene.",

There are some nicely treed and fairly private spots. Well maintained vault toilets. They smell, of course, but are kept very clean. Water spigots are near toilets.  No power.  The hosts are genuinely wonderful people that take pride in their work.  Looking forward to visiting again.",

Top positives were- I was scheduled for 4 nights at first and then changed it to 3 with no problem from the staff, cozy cabins, nice bathrooms, very friendly on the phone every time I called. The biggest positive is that I left my glasses there and they found them and mailed them back to me. A few cons- mattress was lumpy, a bit of highway noise at night, bathroom needed to be cleaned the first night we got there (not terrible though). Overall, I would definitely recommend!",

I also just stayed at Cave Springs and the hosts just let you drive around the place and get lost, people will ask you were things are as you walk around. Manzanita was clean, pretty and easy. It has a light and bright vibe. We have dogs and they were welcomed. We have a disabled dog that we made a very nice spot for and the hosts were very nice about honestly could not have been nicer. Cave Springs seem to not want to deal with dogs and they became stiff when I mentioned we had dogs. Where else can you just be your self and have your things you like but out in open places and nature. The hosts here worked hard to see the place was running correct and pleasurable. This site has a few things about it like some road noise but it is kinda close to town. The creek part is gorgeous of course, to get to it some times you have to walk next to peoples sites and it has a nice vibe so people were ok with that. I saw kids all playing together from all different sites. Even wanting to add our dogs to the fun, that really was cute. I would rather stay here then Cave Springs.",

      "Stayed in a basic cabin. It had a TV with basic cable. The restrooms are clean. They limit your use of water - they truck it in. They have an indoor heated pool. My wife loved it. The Whirlpool was a bit cold. The cafe is great for a KOA. The staff is super friendly. The camp is family friendly with go-karts, put put and several other activities. Enjoyed our stay.",
      "I loved this place. Best KOA for family with kids! I'd say the only thing I didn't like was the bathrooms are not kid friendly. Being a mother of a 2year old who prefers baths, shower time was not pleasant. Very hard to shower such a small kiddo. Maybe have the shower head readjust better. Pool was also down and liked gross... BUT it has a lot to do for the kids!",
      "It's a really nice campground and close to a few lakes for kayaking.  Pet friendly.  Only down fall is that a Lot of spaces r not even close to level.  I mean 4 blocks in back and nothing in front. Make sure to take plenty of blocks for leveling. ",
      "My family spent 3 days here during Labor Day weekend. It was very busy, as expected. We stayed at a tent site. The site was large enough for 3 smaller tents and our instant-up canopy over the provided picnic table. There was also a fire pit that can be used for grilling. Our site also had water and electric. We were near the restrooms, showers, and sinks for washing dishes. This was perfect for us.\n\nWe thought about exploring places outside of the campground, but there was so much we could do at the campground itself. My teenagers loved the pool. They also spent time on the jumping pillow. My 5 year old enjoyed the playgrounds and the train ride. The whole family enjoyed the hayride. We didn't get a chance to use the mini golf, go karts, horseshoe pits, or attend a couple special activities they had.\n\nWe were able to purchase a few items at the campstore which were reasonably priced. There was also a cafe on site.\n\nThe staff was incredibly friendly. They kept the facilities very clean (especially with the number of people at the campground). We had such an enjoyable experience. We will definitely come back.",
      "If your looking for an easy family camping trip this is the place to go. The pool is nice, the kids love the air pillow and Go Larts top it all off with Awesome!"

      "Camping fee was a little pricey, especially considering the host charged us $19 when the posted price was $18. After reading other reviews that cited issues with the host, we decided not to make a big deal over $1. We did not have any other interactions with the host throughout our stay. The campgrounds were clean and the pit toilets were pleasant considering. Campsites are equipped with a cement picnic table and fire ring. Pretty hiking by the creek nearby. There are a couple flood lights on the property that keep it from getting very dark at night but it is quiet. At night, you can hear coyotes in the distance. We only spent one night here but would probably stay again.",
      "We pulled in to see if we wanted to spend the night there and were immediately confronted with a not so kind \"campground host\". Explained we were debating camping or moving on, as he sat and starred at us the entire time which was over the top for the situation. It was a bit awkward and we did not like the constant eyeballing as we talked and that made our decision to move onward.",
      "We only spent 1 night here. The campground was clean and shady. The camp host though doesn't even give you a chance to pay your fee! We had no sooner parked our trailer and were starting to fill out the form when he came and asked us what our plans were, and said we didn't need to fill out the form, he had written down our info on his clipboard , and to pay him, not put the payment in the tube. The next morning someone came in next to us, had no sooner parked, when he was there! They weren't even out of their car! He's a bit too anxious.",

Not too far from radium Warm Springs and the Colorado River is right there. Cliff jumping an awesome this time of the year. Tons of people on the river and had a great time once again.",
      "A nice free campground near the Radium Hot Springs. You can hike to the hot springs. A trail starts at the campground. The campground is free and is in the Radium State Wildlife Area. It is a primitive campground with only a vault toilet as the facility. There are no tables or campground fire pits. There are a lot of rock fire pits scattered about that mark potential campsites. (There are not designated sites - it's dispersed camping, so pick you own spot.) There are trees and some grass. We had a pleasant overnight stay here in a camper van. There is a creek running through the area. The road to get there is hard packed dirt so any car should be able to make it. Small RVs are best but you could get large ones in there with a little work, most likely.  I've saw a small travel trailer there as well as a small class C RV. The hot spring is busy with rafters during the summer. The trail to the hot springs starts out very steep and rocky so be very careful."

      "The setting was nice and my family enjoyed their stay for a night. We camped with four tents in the area behind the RV park. It is a long walking distance to the lake however. AT&T gets a decent signal, Sprint has no service. \n\nI very highly suggest that you purchase your permits from Rusty at the golf course and avoid the two RV park staff at all cost, they are very irrational and demeaning people. Neither I, nor my family saw the signs saying there was a fee to camp and those two drive to our spot and things got quickly out of hand. It all started as two strangers walking up to us saying we had to pay, I asked where the sign was and the man's voice get very loud and direct over a simple question and I said ok, I want to go see this sign real fast and I'll be right back (I'm thinking this could be a scam, so I simply want to verify what they were telling me) and the very first thing out of the man's mouth was \"no that's OK, we'll just call the sheriff\" and immediatly things got heated with his wife telling me to \"keep my mouth shut\" and tried proving herself by showing me recipes of other campers (which anybody can make fake reciepts). All I wanted to do was verify what they were telling me and it led to them yelling at me, my family, and threatening us with the law. These are not good people. Avoid these two and go strait to the lease holder, his name is Rusty. His number can be found in the website.",

Two small boat docks made for loading and unloading your boat now has 20 people and tag you're it kids running all around them, that it's impossible to get out of your boat. No courtesy and would NOT move in fear of losing their fishing spot. On the BOAT dock. People walking through your campsite was ridiculous.  Cans, trash and plastic bags were everywhere.

      "My 2 friends and I camped here in early June 2017. What a gorgeous valley and mountain view! We found the place to be quiet (with only a handful of other campers at most) and have spacious campsites. We were close to some excellent hiking trails. The loop trail at the campground is lovely as well, very easy and enjoyable. Watching dear and elk eat across the valley was a treat. We saw river otter, beaver and their lodges, trout, and various birds. I would definitely camp there again and next time with my wife and kids. No showers. No running water. Plan well.",
      "It's very beautiful here",
      "This is such a beautiful place. My family and I have been camping here for years! an its always amazing. There is so much to do, and it such a relaxing place to be however there is no power, drinkable water or dumpsters so do come prepared, other than that you will definitely love this location! Happy Camping!",
      "Neat area! ",
      "This is a great low-key campground. It's a good spot to be in late Sept when the leaves are changing and the weather gets cooler. I thought it would be a busy weekend, as Sylvan Lake was full, but there weren't many people camping here. Got a great site with a valley and peak view. Lots of places to fly fish and lots of off-road trails for your vehicle if you want to head further up the mountain. "

      "This camp ground has beautiful views and great access to fishing, especially fly fishing. The camp ground has access to trails, creeks and ponds. Restrooms are available here. If you know where to look you can find some amazing places to see and visit. It is bear county but did not see any on this trip. Will be returning this summer to hike the area but will do so when there is not 2 to 3 feet of snow.",
      "It was beautiful to be sure, but you have to use the gravel pits for tent pitching and the stakes just slide ride out, so it's not good for tension tents (like ours).  Only the one real hiking trail that leads to the cave, but if you didn't register before hand and bleach your gear you can't go up there. Bathroom was absolutely disgusting, one of the worst I have ever seen. ",
      "Although there are only 7 sites, on a Thursday night mid-July we were the only campers! Campground & pit toilet were clean; each site spaced farther apart than expected & private; price was right at $8/night; fire pits a good size with grate that folds over top for cooking; log at most (all?) sites to sit on by fire if needed; views of nearby peak beautiful but not seen from every site; 1 mile hike to cave entrance was gorgeous, cool temps in the trees midday with high vegetation, clearly marked narrow but adequate trail, very worth the hike altho we did not enter the cave; last mile of drive to campground very slow going, rocky, need a 4wd vehicle or at least higher clearance vehicle. Raging river below campsites with fence to protect sleep walkers or children from steep cliffs. Enjoy!"

      "My father was finally able to make the cross-country drive from NY to CO to visit me where I live. I booked him a nice campsite (he built a camper van) at Peak One Campground, well in advance, because of the location and views. Upon his arrival, after driving for 3 days straight, not an easy feat for an unhealthy 60 year old man, he arrived to controlling and rude campground caretakers. The owners could not have been more rude to my father, who sometimes has a hard time hearing and understanding what others say, and repeatedly made trips over to his campsite while he was trying to sit by the fire and relax to gripe about such simple issues like which way his car was facing. When I visited him the first night he camped, within 30 seconds of me parking my car next to my Dad's, the campground hosts were there, requesting the payment for parking an extra car(I have no problem paying this fee but at least give me a chance to hug my father who I haven't seen in over a year). All in all, what could have been a beautiful, relaxing trip for my Dad's first time to CO and first time visiting his youngest child out here, was ruined by campground hosts on a power trip who cannot treat others with the respect. Get over yourselves, come down from your power trip, and let people enjoy their vacation.",
      "Great place to camp.  Camp host are great and very helpful ",
      "It's a good place to camp in the Frisco/Breckenridge area.  Watch out for the extra $5 per night per car (after the first one). It's annoying to find out after you get here and have already paid online.",
      "Tent sites are large and space out well. #74 loop c  next to the lake was great. ",
      "Great campground - decent privacy on most sites, and wonderful views of the lake on some. There's a great running/biking trail around the lake from the campground, clean bathrooms, and potable water"

      "Not a bad campground so close to Vail.  But it does get noise from I-70 unless you camp next to the creek in spring when there is a lot of water rushing.  Either that or you listen to traffic rushing.  Best sites for low traffic noise are 9, 10, and 11.  Otherwise, it can get loud.  \nThe host was pleasant but they never picked up trash that some campers left outside the trash cans because they were full.  Given there are bears in the area, this is unacceptable.  The host is supposed to keep the camp clean and having trash in the open is not clean in my opinion.  There is a large dumpster they could have brought it to but they left it sitting for two days.  Lost two stars for that.",
      "Very nice federal park with11 rv sites and more tent sites in East Vail Colorado, off of I 70 at exit 180 and go to the end of the road. Host couple super helpful. New restrooms, no hook ups beautiful stream.",

      "nice place very clean and nice trails. host was friendly and very informant of any questions, the view is amazing of the night sky only complaint is it is rather close to i-70 other than that nice place",

I looked at the cancellation policy and saw that we would be paying a $25 cancellation fee but would get the rest back as we gave over a week's notice to cancel. I contacted the resort and received $6.50 back for one night minus the cancellation fee. I am still waiting for the full refund for the second night and the resort will not return any of my communications. I was excited about the place and was going to try again next year when we could reschedule our trip, but this will not be happening now. I had read the fine print and know about the cancellation fee, but the lack of communication about the refund for the second night is unacceptable. It's been over three weeks now. It's only $35, you'd think they'd just process the refund as we gave sufficient notice...",
      "Nice spot along the lake. Campsites had very little privacy. Lots of junk laying around which gave it a poor vibe. Aside from the new playground the park felt run down and rough. It's unfortunate as the area has potential. 50 plus for a night this was our most expensive stay and the worst park we have visited on our journey. Nice staff park needs to be upkept.",

Next to Williamson Lake, which is also open to people who are not staying on the campsite.\n\nWiFi range is limited to around 30 feet around the office, so you're out of luck if you get a spot towards the end of the site.\n\nDo bring your mosquito repellent, quiet waters will attract a lot of these pests during the warm season!",

The fourth shower leaked so much the buildup of iron on the floor was totally unappealing.  And, you had to pay $5 for each shower!  Insects in the sink made brushing your teeth or washing your face a major challenge. The campground itself was mostly barren and open with no shade but lots of dust. Trash was all over!  There were a few okay tent camp sites but most were either too small or in the open. I had a paper that said the cost was $20 a night but they charged us $25, and there was no store or food available. Do not go here.",
      "As many people stated this is a beautiful campground. The woman checking us in was very friendly even though it was evening when we arrived. The RV and tent campground is down the paved road near the lake. The check-in office, nearby road and teepees are not visible from the campground. We had 50amp electric, water and sewer for $50 a night (no tax as this is on the Reservation). The ground, although a field and the very rainy weather when we were there) was very solid for our 35' RV and spacious. We had a view of the beautiful mountains. We had great Verizon service and no T-Mobile service. We enjoyed our stay!",

      "The staff was great and there's a lot of campsites to pick from. It does get really windy out here, and not much shade. If you don't take a shower by 5 p.m. expect freezing cold water. They say that the showers can have hot water enough for six different showers but it seems to be off by the time then the sun sets. The bathroom only has three showers. The center shower tends to be a shower for kids. The shower head is very low and there a very fim light to help.\nWhere we camped we ended up having a private beach. We had three fire pits to pick from and plenty of parking in the center. The staff was very helpful and accommodating for all of our questions. The washer and dryer were out of service at the time. One of the cheaper sites though! Very close to the park entrance and ten minutes down the road from general store and gas. (Sinclair,  also one of the cheaper had stations- credit card only!))\nI had verizon service.  Nothing for tmobil or sprint."

      "I thoroughly enjoyed my 3 days at Blue Cedars RV Park & Campground. The thing that most impressed me was the women’s washroom! Clean. Clean. A long bank of sinks, one even lower than the rest to accommodation our youngsters. An adequate number of plug-ins, a bright environment, and hot showers were all part of the “plus”. Bonus; showers are included in the campsite fee. The outdoor pool was another bonus. I felt there was ample room at the individual campsites for folks like me not requiring hooks-up. The non-full services sites are adequate in size, close to a water tap, and have a table. The owner has placed a porta-pottie at a convenient location, away from the full-amenities washroom, allowing guests a shorter walk. I felt welcomed at this Park. There are trees, there is grass. When thanking the owner for a great time and commending him on a lovely campsite I was quite surprised when he mentioned some had complained. For what, I wondered? Because some have complained, I wanted to speak of my positive experience.",
      "This seemed like a place operating for maximum profit with the bare amenities and maintenance needed to get by.  I had to walk a long way to the dumpster to throw something away.  Garbage cans would be very helpful.  It sounded like we were camping next to a freeway, which meant not much sleep since we were tent camping.  Bad experience.",
      "I have no idea where all these folks who wrote good reviews stayed, but it wasn't here! Old guy in office is just plain rude.  Locks and unlocks office door when he doesn't want to be bothered. Place is filthy with debris, garbage in fire rings, dog poop, and our site had old patio mat that looks like it's been there for years. Wouldn't even let the dog walk on it. Pool is closed, looks like it hasn't been used in years and area is full of old tires and garbage.  Bathrooms looks like they may have been redone at some point, but they are moldy and smell now.  Wifi is a joke. Old guy probably turns that off and on as well.  Too many other campgrounds in area to stay here. ",
      "Hidden gem. Beautiful stalls, quiet. Showers on site. They even have quaint little cabins you can rent.",
      "We stayed as evacuees from Williams Lake for over a month. We have zero complaints. I'm shocked that so many people have so many complaints but I suppose most people will jump on the internet to complain at their easiest opportunity. Morley (the manager) and Christine were fantastic to our family and many others during the evacuation. They went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and looked after. There was a broken board at the play ground, we mentioned it to them and it was fixed immediately. Yes there is some noise from the highway however you are staying close to town, that is part of camping close to town with Costco and other stores 5 minutes away!......this campground takes pets, they have no restrictions, the showers are not coin operated, therefore FREE. There is WiFI, it's great when the entire campground isn't full and using it but you can't fault the campground for what you think is poor internet as that will happen anywhere you have a large number of people using at once.  I witnessed the campground manager having to clean up garbage from sites where people were just irresponsible about leaving garbage out or leaving garbage behind when they check out. I witnessed him dealing with people on a few occasions over the course of our time there, I never once thought he was unpleasant. He is just to the point and honest, which I appreciate and some people just can't handle! My family will stay here again and this will be our preferred place to camp when we visit PG."

      "It's a decent campground. The view is nice . It was very quiet. There are some full time trailers but you don't really notice them. It is 10 minutes from Town. We didn't talk to a single employee. Booked on line . There was a clip board out side the office with our site number on it, and no need to check in when leaving. The privacy between sites is zero, but they are kinda staggered so you get a little off set. We did not use the shower house's or washrooms .",
      "After reading the reviews, I feel lucky that I had a fantastic experience at Whistler RV. I went tent camping with my husband, my 5 year-old girl and an 8 month-old boy. We also noted that we had a large tent when booking in addition to having child and infant. The campground placed us with a large pad, beautiful tall trees at the background, and pretty close to the bathroom.  Can't ask for a better site for our family.  Customer service, they responded to my email query about fire ban and propane fire pit within couple hours and were courteous.",
      "Never stayed and never will even think about it again. I cancelled 8 days prior to arrival due to forest fires and the road in from our arrival destination was closed. They refused to refund me my money. I would have been better off cancelling the day prior. I would have gotten some sort of refund then. I was trying to be courteous so they could book out our site sooner...They are crooks as far as I'm concerned. I'm sure we were not the only people that cancelled and they were trying to save their profits for the season because of all the fires.",
      "The brochure and website for this park says 'free shuttle to village' and 'free wifi'. When we arrived we were told that the shuttle had not operated for 2 years, and that there was an $11 a day charge for wifi. When we told the girl on the front desk, she said that 'one of our companies hasn't updated it yet'. It's been 2 years... Also, all of the brochures in the Whistler Village Tourist information center (which had clearly been refilled recently) also made those claims. It was simply false advertising. Also, this park is no where near Whistler village. It was a good 10-15 minute drive which meant you also needed to pay the $30 a day RV parking charge at Whistler.",
      "While it is kind of like sardines in a can without much division between sites, the site was level with an amazing view.\nPeople were extremely quiet. No disruption of other people.\nWiFi is an extra fee. It is very hard to get in touch with an employee, by phone, or at the desk."

      "City campground that would likely be fairly busy during the summer months, was very quiet mid week in September. It is fairly open, but the views East are stunning! Get up for the sunrise and walk over to the east side to see it if you don't get a site nearby. Good prices for water and power and they even give you free firewood!!",
      "Picture perfect, peaceful setting with sweeping vistas over the river valley.  Mature trees with unconventional ( non side by side) low density layout makes for a very relaxing setting.  The central showers and washrooms are new and very well maintained.  The playground emulates an old fort with turrets, towers, a small suspension bridge and real live teeter totters.  Great place for a getaway or a one night stopover.",

      "It's a fine campground. The 1-star review by Christopher Lipphardt was meant for Lone Fir Resort in Cougar, WA. Unfortunately it's been cross-posted here  by mistake. (I've flagged it as \"off-topic\" - closest I could get.)",
      "Great USFS campground just off Hwy 20, about 35 miles west of Winthrop, and right outside North Cascades Nat'l Park. Good place to camp if you want to do some hiking and exploring in the Ross and Diablo Lakes areas.",
      "Got to Lone Fir ahead of my group to grab a first come, first serve site. After fully paying for the site for 4 days x $17 = $68, putting the tag up and go out to see WA pass for the afternoon, I came back to someone backing in an RV because the Ranger had come by and pulled the ticket. I followed all the rules, fully paid, but pulled site tab anyway. I haven't gotten any response from the Ranger station, left multiple voicemails, but no one seems to care. \nAnd there is no running water, no camp host and the bathroom ran out of TP. This is the worst experience I've ever had at a NF campground and I routinely camp & climb year round. And all of this over 4th July weekend, the busiest of all.",
      "28 yr Active Duty military, family camper, and world traveler here...Please Do NOT spend your money here.  It's not possible to fully explain my disappointment with the facilities and the owner.  I reviewed other customer reviews before submitting this, and I see a trend with ownership (Jeremy's) attitude towards his customers.  \n    I've never been to a campground that felt so much like a prison camp.  If you have a family with kids or dogs then be prepared for the owner, Jeremy, to loiter around your site and issue you a stern threat of \"kicking you out without a refund\" if there is any noise made after 10pm.  He is intolerant of any noise he can hear.  We found him standing in the dark near our site multiple times trying to eavesdrop...pretty creepy.\n    The RV sites are packed together with fire pits in the strangest locations.  This results in your campfire being behind your back bumper and often 5-10 ft away from your neighbors fire or camper.  There is only one restroom for the entire park, there aren't enough toilets/showers...and it was disgusting every time.   The campground is right next to the highway and you will be forced to hear/watch logging trucks and 4x4s blast by at high speed all night.  The \"free\" wireless is worthless and if you're there when it rains...expect 1-4 inch deep standing water throughout your site.  \n     We had 5 RV's leave the campground early and we refuse to return.  The night before we left I tried giving Jeremy honest helpful feedback...my tone was friendly and calm, but Jeremy became irate and began yelling.  He refused to listen and responded like a petulant child instead of a grown adult.  After he knew we were leaving he then said we were kicked out for being noisy, but admitted that nobody had complained of noise once.  He even went as far as insulting my military service.  Truly disappointed."

      "We stayed the last week of September 2017. I've never stayed in a more beautiful camp, especially for the money. It is well manicured while still felling natural. If the Smurfs ever manage a campground, this is it, magical!  Radium hot springs pool & spa is only ten minutes away.  It's great for recharging & relaxing after a long day trip as it's open some seasons until 11 pm!\n\nCanyon RV Resort is the perfect launching point for day trips to the more expensive to stay at Banff & Chateau Lake Louise areas. Plus you get the gorgeous 90 plus minute drive. The exact drive time will vary depending on how much your crew stops to explore!  There are a dozen places to stop along the way to look out or hike along the emerald green Bow river on the way north to Lake Louise.",
      "Treated badly by owner, because we had reserved and then asked if they would have a site available by the creek when we arrived, even though we hadn't requested it in our reservation request. We were put in site#3 which was barely long enough for our fifth wheel and although we had stated in our request that we had slides the site wasn't wide enough. Because the owner felt that my husband \"embarrassed her ' in the office by asking, she stomps down to the inferior site to continue the argument. When I asked her where we should park the truck she said on the grass, even tho right on the rules it says not even to put a mat on the grass and park on the patio so our slide would fit. We were ready to  unhook and she evicted us! We had accepted the site but she needed to be right and win! She said she had told us on our confirmation that it twas site three, well it's hard to tell what the site is truly like until you get there! Make sure you ask for EVERYTHING you want when you reserve so you don't upset the owner!  UNBELIEVABLE !!! hissy fit! Seen her upset before with  another patron and was crying and complaining to me outside my truck window because he yelled at her, which was unprofessional, to involve me because her feelings were hurt.",
      "Let's get this out of the way first... Yes, the toilets and showers are clean. In fact they sparkle. Day or night they were always clean and fresh.\n\nWe visited the Canyon RV Resort near the end of July 2017 at the end of our trip across western Canada.\n\nThe resort is a beautiful place to have a relaxing break.  The tin lids will love it. A beautiful shallow stream runs through the middle of park creating a dream playground for the adventurous ones.  For those less adventurous it is a wounderful setting for an evening stroll, crossing back and forth over the babbling brook as you work your way from one end of the park to the other.\n\nThe sites are generously sized. Many back right on to the stream creating a very relaxed and pleasant atmosphere.  We stayed in \"Site #0\" - a perfect sized spot for our little RV.  Having stayed at the park, a site next to the stream will be our choice next time.\n\nThe park is lovingly maintained and is always clean. Not once did we spot a single piece of litter. There were lots of dogs in the park, however they are always on a lead and I don't recall hearing a single bark.\n\nCheck out the photos - they don't lie.  This is a beautiful resort with great managers and an obviously devoted and caring team.\n\nBrian J & Sherry T\nSydney, Australia",
      "Delightful site, good showers, laundry, very helpful staff. Trees and pretty planting, hard roads, no dust.\nBrook running through site disguises any noise there may be from road.\nWish we could clone it and install other places.\nBest site on our Canada trip so far.\nPity it was raining!!!",

They said because people would leave the water running. I thought well then just put on shut off valves. Don't charge people. But then they explained that everyone is starting to charge for water and I thought in 5,000 miles, this was the first place to charge for showers. It just comes across as really cheap and I, personally, don't like cheap people. Other than that it was a nice place.",

      "We had a very bad bear experience tent camping here.  After spending several days wilderness camping to peace and quiet in Glacier we got a campsite here for the last night of the season (we were the only tent campers).  They didn't warn us about bear precautions at all, but we ran into a local RV camper who said there had been a grizzly around on a fairly regular basis.  Though we kept all food separate from our tent area, we were woken up at midnight to 2 very agitated grizzly bears in our campground who had most likely been accustomed to feeding off of scraps in the area, and had to leave and spend the night in our car.  On top of all of this, the tent-sites were mostly littered with cow patties.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily dissuade someone with an RV from staying here (it looks like that makes up most of their customers anyways) but they should get rid of the tent-sites if they are not willing to maintain them and take the necessary bear precautions.",
      "This is a lovely, small Campground in the Glacier National Park. They have wonderful hiking trails, outstanding drives, and a pretty good restaurant as well. We were permitted to park our trailer near where the tent campers area was, and leave it while we went for a drive for the day. They even watched the trailer for us and did not charge us. In the morning I hiked my dog not too far away to where the horseback riding was available. I did not enter the horseback riding area. A large, territorial dog rushed out of the horse area toward my dog but was called back by a woman who came out of her trailer. It appeared she was the person in charge of the horseback riding. I said good morning and she did not respond to me, rather just glared at me. Well I'm sure the pup was just doing its job, I would never ride a horse there, due to her discourtesy. I prefer to spend my money where I am made to feel welcome. Yes, my dog was on a leash. No, her dog was not on a leash. We did meet two very friendly Park employees who had a trailer parked next to ours. They were so happy to recommend great drives and things to do in the park for us. They had an awesome dog named Marley who was an absolute angel. I would definitely revisit Glacier National Park and I would definitely stay in the park again. ",
      "We stayed in the dry camping area in our 25' motor home because there were no sites with hookups available.  I'm so glad there weren't!  The dry camping part of this campground felt like a state park.  There were trees and grass.  The sites were spacious with fire rings and picnic tables.  There were ample faucets to obtain water very close to our site. It wasn't noisy or crowded.  We loved it here and wished we had been able to  stay longer.",
      "The place is pretty dated in every respect. It's  in an area with  little to do other than drive through the GNP or hike. They had musical slots going on and we lost a whole day waiting for our new slot to become available. Very inconvenient  and a lot of trouble.We wanted to leave a day early and asked  for  refund on one night 48 hours in advance. But they absolutely do not let go o f your money under any circumstances. Would stay on the West side of Glacier  Park if had it to do over again. The only thing good here is a nice view.",

      "Nicest RV Park in Fairbanks.  Stayed 6 weeks, close to town and convenient to Fred Meyer shopping.  RV Park is part of the larger complex of cottages and restaurant.  The Restaurant/Bar on site is Chena Alaska Grill.  Food is a little pricey but really good.  They have a nice deck for dining as well.  Easy walk to Pikes Landing Restaurant for less expensive food.  Pikes also has a deck on the River.  The Princess Lodge is 1/2 way between the RV Park and Pikes, they have a restaurant and bar as well.  WIFI was excellent.  Cable was horrible, couldn't watch it at our site because it was so fuzzy.  Owners need to clear out or cut up and back the trees on the sites as well as get rid of the sticker bushes that are along some sites.  Seems like the owners also need to capitalize on the riverbank and build it up so guest have a comfortable place to sit and watch the river go buy.   We paid $52 a night in July and August.  Manager is very friendly and helpful.  Would stay again.",

It's the worst we've ever experienced in a campsite!\n The power outlet is at the front of the stall?.....you will need an extra cord to reach it, at least it was that way for our stall. The person working though, was great and got us a cord to reach the outlet. We tried to book elsewhere while we were there but of course, every place was booked on late notice. Don't stay in the North stalls, the road ways in front of the stalls are gravel, very dusty, no one slows down. The other road ways are paved!",

Tem alguns restaurantes próximos (preços elevados) e a praia é logo em frente.\n\nSugiro que levem acessórios de cozinha (prato, copo, talher, panela...) pois lá só tem fogão, geladeira e mesa.\nE não deixem pra comprar muita coisa por lá, os mercadinhos não vendem quase nada... Só o básico do básico.\n\nVale a pena conhecer :)",

      "The campsite is extremely small and if you have a caravan only 6-7 parking spots are available. If you stay in the rooms and you travel by car, the place has no parking spots for you. Given these features, booking is extremely recommended, even in september. But the place is so close to the historical centre (10-15 minutes walking) that you'll soon forget all the downsides of it."

      "My family and I (2 adults and two children aged 10 and 3) camped in our own tent. I have to say this was our first experience of camping in Italy and we found this site to be very different from what we expected or wanted. \n\nOur hope was that the site would be immersed in nature and we could enjoy a tranquil camping experience, with a beach close by where I could take my son fishing etc. Instead what we got was a camp site that seemed to be catering to non-campers, mainly filled with either old dilapidated caravans or small wooden huts, the area for camping was smallish and in-between a large restaurant and a Bar / club and the other side was a fairly busy and noisy road. Our first night was spent being kept awake by loud dance music playing until 3AM!! and we had even been careful to pitch as far away from the bar/club as we could. \n\nThe ground in the camp seemed to be made of a layer of fine dust about 2cm deep and then sold rock so you had to find large rocks to hold tent ropes down or tie to the few trees that were about, tent pegs were not really an option. \n\nWe had asked for an electrical point when we ordered online, but when we arrived we were told that we would need a very long extension cable to reach the nearest one, and that we would have to provide it ourselves. They recommended we go to town and buy one, in the end we opted just to use our small solar charger for charging phones, and that worked okay for us but made things harder. \n\nThere is barely any mobile reception at the camp (we are on Tre) I don't know about other providers, and no wifi in the camp except for right outside the check-in desk/hut, so we found looking after work remotely very difficult. On the plus side toilet and showering facilities seemed clean although everywhere seemed to be quite run down including the kids playgound. \n\nWe never tried the pool (€5 for half the day seemed a little steep and we preferred the beach anyway). The beach is close but across a road is only pebble and rock which we did lots of fishing at and was the highlight of our stay but there is also a nice sand beach with a good bar a little further on. \n\nWe had meant to stay for a whole week but due to the constant noise late at night (last night was really bad karaoke) and oppressive heat due to lack of shade in the camping area we left after only 5 nights and would have left sooner if we could have. For those that just want discos, bingo and pizza this place might be at the top of your list, but for us it was everything we didn't want in a camp site. :(( I think in future we will be looking for sites that cater for nature lovers wanting to experience true camping. Less disco and more guitars around an open fire, less bingo and more bongo IYKWIM.",

      "Well maintained camping village. Lots of space for RVs. Places for tents have lots of shade. Very clean and modern sanitary. On site restaurant and market. Lots of families with small children and in the evening an entertainment programme.",
      "il villaggio camping si trova su di una spiaggia di sabbia mediamente  grossa. il livello del mare scende subito a 80cm circa per poi degradare dolcemente. per i bambini consiglio di fare 300mt verso sud per trovare una piccola spiaggetta tra gli scogli dove il mare è piu basso. Il villaggio è abbastanza curato per quanto riguarda il verde. Le piazzole abbastanza grsndi ed alcune ben ombreggiate, altre meno. I servizi non sempre sono puliti, ma siamo stati nella prima settimana di Agosto. Alcuni piccoli dettagli lasciano l'amaro in bocca: ad esempio gli attaccapanni nelle docce che sono tutti rotti e spesso ruotano facendo cadere i vestiti a terra. Oppure i bagni privi di porta rotolo: dettagli, ma che si fanno sentire, a mio parere.\nNon eccelle per la cortesia al ristorante dove chiedere una pizza divisa in 2 gusti per i bambini è sembrato essere una richiesta quasi impossibile. il market offre il minimo indispensabile. L'animazione serale non è invasiva, anzi, forse da più fastidio l'animazione del villaggio attiguo.\nLa sera spesso si sente un forte odore di acque grigie provenire dal depuratore del campeggio, specialmente nelle piazzole vicino all'ingresso.",
      "Sono stato dal 18 al 30 giugno 2017. Personale impeccabile, abbiamo riscontrato piccoli problemi nel bungalow che prontamente son stati risolti, massima disponibilità e cordialità da parte di tutto lo staff, complimenti! La spiaggia si trova tra 50 e 150 metri dalla struttura, dipende dalla locazione dove si alloggia, quindi è comunque attaccata al lido. All'interno del camping vi è un ristorante/pizzeria ed un mini market con buona qualità/prezzo, con degli scivoli per i bambini. Esiste il Wi-Fi gratuito al ristorante, ove si può rimanere anche senza consumare. Luogo pulitissimo e ben organizzato, con la raccolta rifiuti differenziata, nessun schiamazzo di giorno e soprattutto la notte. Se dovessi trovare il cosiddetto pelo nell'uovo a questo camping impeccabile ma che tuttavia non ha colpe e non può far nulla, direi che il mare non è quello delle cartoline, purtroppo non è sempre calmo e a volte risulta pure inquinato. Ma ciò è naturale, nessuno può far nulla. Intorno non vi è quasi nulla da visitare. Giusto le spiagge limitrofe. Voto complessivo vacanza 9,5/10, ci ritornerò sicuramente.",
      "Campeggio pulito, tranquillo, confortevole, sn 3 anni che vengo qui e non mi sono mai pentito. All' interno del Cigno Bianco è  presente un ristorante/pizzeria di buona qualità. I servizi igienici sono pulitissimi, grazie ad una signora particolarmente attenta.\nLe piazzole non sn completamente all'ombra, poiché alcune  prive di alberi, cmq ottima la pineta con le sedie a sdraio.\nIl mare eccezionale a due passi dal campeggio.\nPossibilità di grigliare pesce/carne negli innumerevoli barbecue, presenti    in tutto il campeggio.",
      "Siamo stati ospiti del campeggio nel mese di luglio e devo dire che ci siamo trovati veramente bene! Tutto è molto curato ed estremamente pulito, c'è molta cura del posto e tutto il personale è cortese e disponibile. Consiglio anche qualche cena nel ristorante del campeggio, buono e prezzi più che onesti! Del mare e le spiaggie c'è poco da dire, sei in Sardegna, quindi sono semplicemente splendidi. "

Il fritto non era eccezionale, ma nel complesso siamo rimasti soddisfatti. Un paio di ingredienti (gorgonzola di pecora e prosciutto di cinghiale) prettamente tipici, hanno sicuramente fatto la differenza. Prezzi accessibili, personale cordiale. Ci tornerei.",

Angolo di Sardegna con mare favoloso non ancora troppo turistico.\nSpiaggia enorme con un sacco di spazio.\nEro in un bungalow da 4 posti, ma eravamo solo in 2. Molto carino, con tutte le comodità, all'ombra con terrazzino esterno e spazio di fronte in modo da non avere gli altri bungalow appiccicati!\nIl campeggio non è grandissimo, ma molto ben tenuto, sempre molto pulito, con tutti i confort ed il necessario. Vaste zone in ombra, area natura con gli animali e lo spazio coperto per yoga e pilates, zona animazione, a 400 mt. dalla spiaggia libera.\nZona giochi bimbi, zona barbecue.\nAvevo la mezza pensione: una delizia! La colazione ottima, varia ed abbondante con torte salate e dolci spesso fatte in casa.\nLa cena con primo, secondo e contorno a scelta tra tre portate, tra cui sempre una di pesce, oppure a scelta pizza.\nCucina semplice e sana, tutto buonissimo e fresco, porzioni abbondanti. Veramente complimenti!\nPersonale gentile, disponibile, preparato.\nWi-fi gratuito.\nCollegamenti vari possibili con aeroporto di Cagliari.\nOttimo rapporto qualità-prezzo.\nUn vero piccolo paradiso che consiglio e dove tornerò!",

Higieniczne odpady kobiece leżące w rogu toalety źle świadczą o pozostawiającej je kobiecie, ale to że leżały kilka dni to już wina braku sprzątania.

Senza prendere l'auto sei al mare...proprio due passi!! La sicurezza e i controlli non mi sono sembrati molto accurati, le persone entrano e escono come vogliono... ma un ottimo campeggio!! Adatto alle piccole e anche alle grandi tende.... i bambini si divertono moltissimo e i genitori si possono rilassare....",

      "Jestem zaskoczona tak pozytywnymi opiniami o tym campingu. Na plus na pewno położenie campingu - okolica ładna, rzeka i jezioro mają swój urok i jeśli ktoś pragnie wypocząć na łonie natury to jest to dobre miejsce. Na minus przede wszystkim brak odpowiedniej ilości pryszniców i toalet.4 prysznice na tak ogromne pole namiotowe to bardzo mało, kolejki są praktycznie cały czas (byliśmy po długim weekendzie, nie wyobrażam sobie kolejek w jego trakcie). Z jednego końca campingu na drugi przejście zajmuje ok 15 minut a prysznice są tylko na początku, dodatkowo są dwie toalety na środku campingu, które do najczystszych nie należą niestety. Gorąca woda 24h na dobę to  mit, woda była co najwyżej letnia a jej ciśnienie nie pozwalało na spłukanie włosów - to w połączeniu z temperaturą ok 16 stopni na zewnątrz, plus brak miejsca na przebranie, bo pod prysznic wchodzi się z zewnątrz na pewno nie gwarantuje komfortu.  Z podłączeniem do prądu jest problem ale to mogę zrozumieć. Miejsce ma potencjał jednak jest wiele do zrobienia.",
      "Территория кемпинга огромная и вмещает большое количество людей и машин. Рядом берег реки где очень красиво. Не понравился один туалет и душ на весь лагерь. Чтобы в него попасть нужно 5 мин топать в другой конец лагеря. Бар работает до 10 вечера. Не на всей территории можно найти электричество. Нет фонарей на территории. Территория не ухоженная- встречается много заросших мест прямо посреди лагеря.",
      "Urokliwe miejsce dzięki pobliskiej rzece i znacznej ilości drzew dających cień. Dużo atrakcji w pobliżu, zarówno sportowych, rekreacyjnych  jak i historycznych. Do piątej gwiazdki brakowało mi lepszej drogi na tyłach kempingu i lepszej jakości wody zalewu u wylotu rzeki. Mimo to polecam. ",
      "Świetne miejsce do odpoczynku i relaksu. Bardzo ładne widoki, możliwość spacerów łowienia ryb, zbierania grzybów. Plac zabaw dla dzieci, boisko do siatkówki plażowej, toalety, prysznice. Sam kemping tak zróżnicowany że każdy znajdzie miejsce aby się rozbić z namiotem czy kamperem. Polecam wszystkim!!!",
      "Wieczne kolejki do prysznicy i toalet, duże zatloczenie na polu. Poza tym głośna muzyka po 22. Pomimo próśb o przyciszenie( gdyż byliśmy z małymi dziećmi a muzykę włączyli goście z sasiedzkiego namiotu i mieli niezła impreze) spotkało się to jeszcze z agresja z ich strony. Zmuszeni byliśmy wezwać policję gdyż kolega został uderzony. Po przyjeździe policji stróż który był świadkiem zdarzenia stwierdził że niczego nie widział. Zmuszeni byliśmy wyjechać z pola wcześniej gdyż nie czuliśmy się tam bezpiecznie."

Spiaggia tranquilla e mare strabello. Animazione ok, ristorante direi per turisti non italiani, qualità del cibo discreta insomma.\nMinimarket quasi inesistente se facciamo caso a ciò che è in vendita, veramente poca roba.\n3 stelle sono giuste secondo me.",
      "Un bellissimo posto dove rilassarsi e divertirsi.\nPerfetto per bambini, ragazzi e adulti. \nAnimatori bravissimi! Sempre cordiali, simpatici e professionali. \nIl mare è pulitissimo ma subito alto. \nAll'interno del camping ci sono quattro piscine (una con idromassaggio) il bar, un ristorante/pizzeria, un market, un campo calcetto/tennis e un piccolo parco giochi per bambini.\nIl campeggio è pulito ed è curato quotidianamente.\n5 stelle meritate!",
      "Eigentlich schöner Platz, aber die Instandhaltung wird leider schwer vernachlässigt. Stromverteiler fallen reihenweise auseinander, in jeder Dusche ist irgendwas abgebrochen, Warmwasser gab es nur manchmal, bei den Wäschewaschbecken gar nicht (man soll ja die teuren Münzen für die Maschine kaufen...). Kein Toilettenpapier. Und die Waschhäuser sind sehr weit entfernt vom Campingbereich mitten in den Bungalows... Vier Sterne gab's wohl nur wegen der Pools. Die sind wirklich spitzenmäßig.",
      "Campeggio grande. \n•™Solo due blocchi servizi situati uno vicino all'altro molto distanti dalle piazzole camper. Per essere un campeggio di quattro stelle e per quello che si paga, potrebbero aggiungere blocchi servizi anche in altri punti del campeggio. \nPer lavare le stoviglie, lavarsi i denti e farsi la doccia, si deve fare un kilometro avanti in dietro. \n•Piazzole su terra battuta sotto equalipti. Sono ombreggiate ma polvere ovunque per terra. Da un senso di sporco. \n\n•I bidoni della raccolta differenziata  sono situati in punti diversi. Tutti sono aperti, mai coperti. Perché? Perfino quello della frazione indifferenziata e non solo la plastica o il vetro. In tutti i punti che ho visto, i bidoni sono aperti. Non mi sembra che qualche campeggiatore abbia dimenticato di chiuderli, bensì una scelta di chi gestisce il campeggio. Inutile dire che attorno ai bidoni volano mosche.\n\nRistorante e pizzeria ok, nulla di che e un po' caruccio.\nE' tutto soggettivo naturalmente. Parlo da camperista. \n\nLa ciliegina sulla torta: andiamo per pagare e mi trovo nella ricevuta la voce Tessera club €12 x 4 giorni (3 adulti). Non mi era stato detto ne al momento della prenotazione ne al arrivo in campeggio che la tessera club è obbligatoria. È un obbligo per utilizzo piscina (orari ristretti e non sì può entrare quando a uno pare), animazione (anche se a uno può non importargli nulla di averlo), e attività sportive. Ma quali attività sportive???? \n\nQuello che è intollerabile è la formula. Perché non pubblicare il prezzo finale sul sito? Anziché€13 ditte che è €17 a persona. \nPensa se uno si deve sentire costretto dì pagare per servizi che non interessano. Ma siamo in vacanza o dove??? Tasse sopra tasse!!! \n\nEvitate se potete. Ci sono altri campeggi onesti e aree attrezzate che con 20 Euro ti offrono tutto quanto necessario per rilassarsi di fronte ad un mare stupendo. \nAlla faccia delle 4 stelle!!!\n"

      "Good service. Not good structure ",
      "My boyfriend and me loved this camping place. Although the beach is very small and not so beautiful, we still felt very comfortable there. The prices are cheap, the toilets clean and the staff was very friendly. One minus point might be the car-noise coming from the main street in front of the place. In the night though, its very silent and all you will hear is the water flowing. ",
      "We spent there 2 days at the end of June 2015. Before we stayed in other camping grounds like in Cala Gonone and Vignola Mare. Compared to these, this was a very basic place for spending the nights in a tent. The price is okay and the staff there is friendly, but the whole look n feel is somehow very oldfashioned. The ground itself is also not very tidy, a lot of things looks like nobody cares about it. Maybe it has to do with the fact that this one is operated by the local community.\nAs there was no much business at this time, the market was equiped just with basic food. So you had to go to other supermarkets around the area to get good stuff. There is also the Capitana beach just 300 m away. But I can't recommend it due to the fact, that the sand area is very tiny and dirty, the water was full of organic tree material and its surrounded by the beach wall. So you better drive 15 - 20 min. to go somewhere else in this area with beautiful beaches.\nConclusion: if you want to visit Cagliari, want to save money for the overnight stay and have not higher expectations, go there. Otherwise you look for a airbnb opportunity or hotel."

      "one of the best campings in sardegna, you can find beautiful pitches with your van, very close to the sea. also a lot of short trips in the area can be done. the restaurant is also excellent and our kids liked the animation, which was not too loud and did not stop too late at night. quite pricy in the main season, but worth the money."

      "Never again ! Do not get mistreated by the beautiful views on the beach with the Low Tatra mountains in the distance. This camping has only one purpose, to make easy money over the heads of its visitors. We were arriving on a saturday on this so called 'family friendly' camping and at first glance everything seemed to be perfect on this camping so we payed 4 nights in advance. Trying to sleep in two tents with our small family I think we had about 3 hours of sleep thanks to some drunk and awful noisy guests  who seemed to be given complete freedom to do whatever they like by the camping management for instance to put on their car stereo from 21:00 PM til 5:00 AM in the morning meanwhile shouting and singing loud around a big fire. They also have a row of wooden rental lodges next to the camping field. Also from that location came a lot of noise and even shouting of stupiditly drunk men and women during most of the night. Because the stoney beach near the lake is not restricted to camping guests, you can pay as an external visitor and get a brightly colored wristband like the campingguests are given to have access to the campingbeach for a day (We noticed several times there was no control at all on who was visiting) , there is another problem when you arrive in the afternoon to get onto the campingsite again. The parkingplace before the gateway is not prepared at alll for so many cars so it's a huge problem to get your car back on the camping again. When you look at the sanitair it is dirty, not sufficient. You see a a lot of full garabage bags that seem to have been forgotten. There are only one or two places were you can wash your dishes. This camping seems to have it all, but when you stay there for just one night, you feel like it is one big fraud. And then, with  just a couple of hours of sleep next morning you walk to the reception near the gateway and explain what happened during the night, do not expect too much any appoplogies from the young camping personnel they just say \"Yes, we went there three times to ask if they can be more quiet.\" \"But i was noth here my collegue was there\" and \"But we don't know who these people were.\"  ..and you ask politely to refund the nights you payed in advance they'll point you to a paper taped on the reception desk which says: \"We never refund any money payed in advance\" and then it is clear: This camping is not ment to make you comfortable whatsoever, it is just about filling a campsite on what essentially is a beautiful location with too many people and making big bucks. My advice to anyone with children looking for a nice camping: SKIP THIS MARA CAMPING.(!!)",
      "Love this campground! There are lots of perks and things to do for visitors of the mara camping. Very clean and friendly to children, next to the lake! Nice showers, kitchen, only missing a fridge for tenters.",
      "Wifi was not working in all camping. Clean, near the lake. Staff very helpful",
      "A camp with the nice view on High Tatras and Low Tatras as well, behind the fun boats is Low Tatras peak named Chopok with the cableway..."
