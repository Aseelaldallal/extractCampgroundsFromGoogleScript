      "This is a camping ground that feels very public. There is nothing much dividing the camping space with the local houses and the guests dropping in for swimming at the beach. It therefore felt a little odd leaving the tent there for a day while we went sightseeing. At 円1200 per night for a couple, plus 円300 for the sun shelter and 円80 for rubbish disposal, it was okay value. Proximity to the closest conbini is about 2km. There is a little supermarket very close by but opens a bit later in the morning so not great for breakfast items.\nPretty basic but very clean with excellent beach access, dog friendly and excellent views of beautiful coastline.",

      "無料キャンプ場。\nドコモ圏外。ガチでクマ出没注意。無人。\nバイク乗り入れ可能、水道は飲用不可。\nトイレは水洗＆洋式で超キレイ。\nトイレにコンセントあり。\n無料なのに設備は凄い。\n\n雨の時は炊事場にテント張ると濡れなくて楽。\n雨のせいか、お盆の時でも泊まり客ゼロ。\n\n基本最高なんだが、携帯（ドコモ）圏外は痛い！天気予報とか情報収集できない。\n北の高速道路近くまで行くとLTE使えた。\n\n温泉街に近いから電波は大丈夫だろうと勝手に思ってたが、携帯電波が圏外というのは想定外だった。\n今から別のとこに移動するのも面倒だし、雨でまた準備するのめんどくさいし、仕方ないのでやることなくて20時には就寝。\n翌朝5時までほぼノンストップで爆睡しました。たまにはこういうのもいいのかもしれない。\n\n翌朝、キャンプ場を一周して見てまわると熊出没注意の看板あったw\n今回は偶然大丈夫だったが、ヤバかった。\nたしかに、熊が出ても全く不思議ではない原生林のどまん中。\nトイレに避難棟として逃げ込むことも可能だが、携帯の電波が来てないので助けを呼べない。\n熊が出たら終了～～～☆　である。\n\nここでの泊まりはあまりおすすめしない。\nデイキャンプとか大集団でのキャンプならいいかも。\n\nたくさん写真撮ってきたので参考にしてください。\n\nちなみに帯広でのキャンプは、十勝川公園で勝手に野宿してる人も多いです。"

There is a nice pebble beach across the road from the campground with great sunset views.  The campground also organizes outdoor activities in the area, including kayaking and rafting. However, the tours were all booked when we arrived, so advanced booking is recommended. Highly recommend the site and the area, in general.",

      "Only one caveat, due to this being on the windward side and its elevation, early morning rains are expected. They usually taper off by 08:00~09:00, in late July. Lots of natural beauty, and activities for youngsters on weekends. Many sites are surrounded by walls of vegetation for seclusion. An excellent place to recharge one's spirit.",
      "いった時期が悪かったのか、地面に蛾の幼虫かな？白い虫が異常発生していてつらかった。サイトからトイレに行くまでに往復で５０匹はつぶしたかな。\nそれがなければ非常にいいところだと思いますが、ハサミムシも異常発生していたのか、朝起きたらテーブルの裏にびっしり。\n帰宅後もそこかしこから５匹ほど出てきました。今年、今の時期(2017/09）だけだとは思いますが。。。",
      "今回、妻の希望で利用させていただきました。\nとにかく自然がいっぱいで率直に最高でした。お盆の繁忙期でしたが隣のサイトとの区切りもしっかりしてゴミゴミした感じもなくのんびり過ごせました。\nまた体験カリキュラムが充実していて子供達も私たち夫婦も皆が楽しめました。\nあいにく朝晩は雨で昼間も殆ど雨が降ったりやんだりで、噂に聞いていた星空は見れませんでしたが、雨なりに楽しめました。\n小さい子供さんがいらっしゃる方にも、そうでない方にも間違いなくオススメです。\n私はリピート間違いなしです。\nただ体験などをするなら結構な予算が必要です。",
      "とても広い。アクティビティが多く、子供を預けられるようなので、家族にはおすすめ。ただ、それぞれお金はかかる。無印の店が夜19:00まで営業しているので、足りないものがあったらアイスも含めて買いに行ける。焚き火台が置いてあったので、薪を買って、使ってみてもいいかも。トイレが汲み取り式で、においが臭かった。お店のトイレだけは清潔でにおいも大丈夫。\n　また山にあるので、仕方ないことだが、運転に自信のない人は、気を付けてほしい。ガードレールがどういうわけかあちこちヘコんでいた。まあ、高地なので、夏でも涼しい。1080円でニジマスの餌釣り1時間が楽しめる。（５匹まで）リリース禁止なので、その際は、食することになると思うが、腹を出した方が気持ちよく食べられると思うので、ナイフを持参するとよいでしょう。",
      "無印良品が経営する高規格キャンプ場です。\nサイトは林間で区画されており、開放感はありませんが隣を気にしないですみます。\n標高が高いので夏も涼しいです。お盆を過ぎると夜は寒いぐらいになります。\n比較的高い料金の割に露店風呂は別料金なのが残念。"

The Restaurant/Bar on site is Chena Alaska Grill.  Food is a little pricey but really good.  They have a nice deck for dining as well.  Easy walk to Pikes Landing Restaurant for less expensive food.  Pikes also has a deck on the River.  The Princess Lodge is 1/2 way between the RV Park and Pikes, they have a restaurant and bar as well.  WIFI was excellent.  Cable was horrible, couldn't watch it at our site because it was so fuzzy.  Owners need to clear out or cut up and back the trees on the sites as well as get rid of the sticker bushes that are along some sites.  Seems like the owners also need to capitalize on the riverbank and build it up so guest have a comfortable place to sit and watch the river go buy.   We paid $52 a night in July and August.  Manager is very friendly and helpful.  Would stay again.",
      "Nice RV Park.  Haven't used their WiFi or cable, so can't comment on that.  Good water pressure, decent showers.  Plenty of washer and dryer, 3.00$ per load for each.  Sites are good sized.  ",
      "Convenient location. Grounds are well kept. Sites are close together but not quite on top each other. Staff friendly and helpful. Would return to this RV park again.",
      "Nothing we found to complain about. Staff was helpful, even helped us figure out where we were going to get some supplies. Was quiet enough for being in town and certainly wouldn't hesitate coming back. ",
      "Nice people and the hotel is close to downtown. I am not sure if a hotel/RV Park can get a 5 but...."

      "Harassment is the only way to describe our experience with the many park staff. We attempted to camp here with 2 couples for a week. We arrived first and set up our tent on the gravel tent spot and parked our car in a spot the looked like it was meant for a car as it was gravel as well. Our friends arrived a short time later and did the same. The first parks Canada staff came by \"Hello, bonjour\" and ripped us a new one for the placement of the car as well as the amount of \"units\" on the site. Again we paid for 4 ppl and had 2 tents, yet the cars that fit with tones of room left were too many units. Our friends had checked in at the front when they arrived and we're told this was fine. We moved the car and we're given a \"pass\" by the parks guy on the number of tents. Next day same thing. \"Hello, bonjour\" from a different parks employee saying we had to many units. We explained the situation and again the parks Canada worker \"gave us a pass\" to have 2 tents for  2 couples. Then \"Hello, bonjour\" you have bear attractants on your table as we had just finished lunch and had yet to put away the sealed coke cans or my toothbrush. Next day \"hello, bonjour\" again with the number of units on the site. Again a \"oh then don't worry about it\" once we had spoken to them about the situation. We came to fear the parks Canada trucks doing there ever so frequent checks. Now again this morning at 0830 while asleep in our tent that has been in the same spot for 5 nights and had 5 different parks Canada employees inspect it we are woken up by yet another \"hello, bonjour.\" Now this guy says our tent in on green space. I promise you it is on gravel. The harrassment has been non stop from the staff here. There are no showers in the bathrooms. The water runs from the taps a milky snow white color. Wabasso is not a place to come camping with friends. Perhaps with a family that can share a camper or tent but their expectations for other groups is unrealistic. The staff is rude and does not communicate with eachother which truly has put a dark cloud over this whole trip for us. Won't be returning."

Get up for the sunrise and walk over to the east side to see it if you don't get a site nearby. Good prices for water and power and they even give you free firewood!!",

The central showers and washrooms are new and very well maintained.  The playground emulates an old fort with turrets, towers, a small suspension bridge and real live teeter totters.  Great place for a getaway or a one night stopover.",

(Unfortunately, they were fully booked, so we stayed at another campground and just came here during the days)",
      "We were excited to stay here for two nights in August but had to cancel due to unforeseen circumstances. I looked at the cancellation policy and saw that we would be paying a $25 cancellation fee but would get the rest back as we gave over a week's notice to cancel. I contacted the resort and received $6.50 back for one night minus the cancellation fee. I am still waiting for the full refund for the second night and the resort will not return any of my communications. I was excited about the place and was going to try again next year when we could reschedule our trip, but this will not be happening now. I had read the fine print and know about the cancellation fee, but the lack of communication about the refund for the second night is unacceptable. It's been over three weeks now. It's only $35, you'd think they'd just process the refund as we gave sufficient notice...",

We don't use the washrooms and didn't have to do laundry. I wish the wifi was better in this day and age there should be no problem with wifi but as we are only staying 1 night we found this campground to be really nice",
      "Nice spot along the lake. Campsites had very little privacy. Lots of junk laying around which gave it a poor vibe. Aside from the new playground the park felt run down and rough. It's unfortunate as the area has potential. 50 plus for a night this was our most expensive stay and the worst park we have visited on our journey. Nice staff park needs to be upkept.",
      "Small campsite with limited (but clean!) facilities. Next to Williamson Lake, which is also open to people who are not staying on the campsite.\n\nWiFi range is limited to around 30 feet around the office, so you're out of luck if you get a spot towards the end of the site.\n\nDo bring your mosquito repellent, quiet waters will attract a lot of these pests during the warm season!"

Many campgrounds were closed for the season and I'm so glad we found this place with their hours posted online. The office had two adorable dogs and a cat ready for affection. The site itself was nice - full hookups for a very decent price. We didn't have the right type of plug and the office actually carried an adaptor and helped us out (it was free to borrow, but we ended up buying it in case of use in the future). The bathrooms were pristine and the showers so warm and steamy (and free!) - perfect for a cold autumn night. Clayton even gave us a few bulbs of fresh garlic from his friend's place, which we happily used to cook dinner :) Overall fantastic place to stay.",

Don't expect absolute serenity, but it's does die down overnight. \n Previous comments have stated too, there's a high percentage of long-term residents.  \n\nOverall good place, and good price.\n\n",

With so many visitors staying-at and entering the park via West Glacier, St. Mary offered ease of access but with much less traffic and congestion. Wished the campground had more shade, but it's a trade-off for spectacular views of Lewis Range for both sunrise and sunsets. With the right expectations, you will be very pleased with St. Mary Campground.",

      "Wow, what a great location for tent camping. Not only can you see the mountains 24 hours a day, but you're close to the river, which apparently a curious moose cow wanders up from regularly, though we never got to see her. There are all types of campsites, but we chose one that was hemmed in by thick vegetation to minimize having to see our neighbors endeavors. The thick brush was home to numerous birds, including a hummingbird visiting the dense stand of phlox growing between campsites. Lots of woodpeckers, chickadees, and nuthatches, plus a Least Chipmunk venturing out to look for leftovers...sorry little buddy, but this is bear country, so we ran an extra clean camp!",

If the Smurfs ever manage a campground, this is it, magical!  Radium hot springs pool & spa is only ten minutes away.  It's great for recharging & relaxing after a long day trip as it's open some seasons until 11 pm!\n\nCanyon RV Resort is the perfect launching point for day trips to the more expensive to stay at Banff & Chateau Lake Louise areas. Plus you get the gorgeous 90 plus minute drive. The exact drive time will vary depending on how much your crew stops to explore!  There are a dozen places to stop along the way to look out or hike along the emerald green Bow river on the way north to Lake Louise.",
      "Treated badly by owner, because we had reserved and then asked if they would have a site available by the creek when we arrived, even though we hadn't requested it in our reservation request. We were put in site#3 which was barely long enough for our fifth wheel and although we had stated in our request that we had slides the site wasn't wide enough. Because the owner felt that my husband \"embarrassed her ' in the office by asking, she stomps down to the inferior site to continue the argument. When I asked her where we should park the truck she said on the grass, even tho right on the rules it says not even to put a mat on the grass and park on the patio so our slide would fit. We were ready to  unhook and she evicted us! We had accepted the site but she needed to be right and win! She said she had told us on our confirmation that it twas site three, well it's hard to tell what the site is truly like until you get there! Make sure you ask for EVERYTHING you want when you reserve so you don't upset the owner!  UNBELIEVABLE !!! hissy fit! Seen her upset before with  another patron and was crying and complaining to me outside my truck window because he yelled at her, which was unprofessional, to involve me because her feelings were hurt.",
      "Let's get this out of the way first... Yes, the toilets and showers are clean. In fact they sparkle. Day or night they were always clean and fresh.\n\nWe visited the Canyon RV Resort near the end of July 2017 at the end of our trip across western Canada.\n\nThe resort is a beautiful place to have a relaxing break.  The tin lids will love it. A beautiful shallow stream runs through the middle of park creating a dream playground for the adventurous ones.  For those less adventurous it is a wounderful setting for an evening stroll, crossing back and forth over the babbling brook as you work your way from one end of the park to the other.\n\nThe sites are generously sized. Many back right on to the stream creating a very relaxed and pleasant atmosphere.  We stayed in \"Site #0\" - a perfect sized spot for our little RV.  Having stayed at the park, a site next to the stream will be our choice next time.\n\nThe park is lovingly maintained and is always clean. Not once did we spot a single piece of litter. There were lots of dogs in the park, however they are always on a lead and I don't recall hearing a single bark.\n\nCheck out the photos - they don't lie.  This is a beautiful resort with great managers and an obviously devoted and caring team.\n\nBrian J & Sherry T\nSydney, Australia",

      "This weekend (July Long) was our first time staying here, it was a last minute decision, and we were lucky they even had a spot available...  I thought it was a cute little campsite! I love that it sits along the river and can’t wait to camp there again and spend the day floating down. It is really close to the highway, so of course it’s a bit loud but I didn’t find it unbearable. The only 2 things that I didn’t like was the bathrooms, they stunk so bad… I guess that comes along with outhouses, but damn it was bad. And the mosquitoes were horrible! Couldn’t sit still for a minute without swatting away mosquitoes… but that could have just been this time. \nI’ll definitely visit again. If it’s on your way and you need somewhere to stay, I think it’s just fine!",
      "Many sites on the Bow river & on a creek. First come first serve camping available. Had some friendly wildlife encounters. Mosquito population was high. Very scenic, there is vehicle noise from nearby highway. ",
      "Convenient location close to Banff and Calgary. Close convenience store. Awesome scenic location next to the river and relatively spacious camping spaces. Only down sides were thick mosquitoes and smelly toilets but worth it for the camping. ",
      "I went tenting here in a group of four with two tents and had to pay $26 a night PER TENT. It was a rip off considering there was no services besides a shared out house and water pump. If you are going in a group I suggest all sleeping in one big ten or trailer because you will save $26 a night. Also the person working at the campsite was not friendly at all.",
      "Pretty basic provincial campground with only camping spots and toilets. No showers and or garbage bins (that I could find). It's near the highway, but the traffic is far enough away that it's not loud, unlike the camping sites in Canmore where the traffic is very close. Very few bugs when I was there last weekend. "

I haven't gotten any response from the Ranger station, left multiple voicemails, but no one seems to care. \nAnd there is no running water, no camp host and the bathroom ran out of TP.

If you have a family with kids or dogs then be prepared for the owner, Jeremy, to loiter around your site and issue you a stern threat of \"kicking you out without a refund\" if there is any noise made after 10pm.  He is intolerant of any noise he can hear.  We found him standing in the dark near our site multiple times trying to eavesdrop...pretty creepy.\n    The RV sites are packed together with fire pits in the strangest locations.  This results in your campfire being behind your back bumper and often 5-10 ft away from your neighbors fire or camper.  There is only one restroom for the entire park, there aren't enough toilets/showers...and it was disgusting every time.   The campground is right next to the highway and you will be forced to hear/watch logging trucks and 4x4s blast by at high speed all night.  The \"free\" wireless is worthless and if you're there when it rains...expect 1-4 inch deep standing water throughout your site.  \n     We had 5 RV's leave the campground early and we refuse to return.  The night before we left I tried giving Jeremy honest helpful feedback...my tone was friendly and calm, but Jeremy became irate and began yelling.  He refused to listen and responded like a petulant child instead of a grown adult.  After he knew we were leaving he then said we were kicked out for being noisy, but admitted that nobody had complained of noise once.  He even went as far as insulting my military service.  Truly disappointed."

      "It's a decent campground. The view is nice . It was very quiet. There are some full time trailers but you don't really notice them. It is 10 minutes from Town. We didn't talk to a single employee. Booked on line . There was a clip board out side the office with our site number on it, and no need to check in when leaving. The privacy between sites is zero, but they are kinda staggered so you get a little off set. We did not use the shower house's or washrooms .",
      "After reading the reviews, I feel lucky that I had a fantastic experience at Whistler RV. I went tent camping with my husband, my 5 year-old girl and an 8 month-old boy. We also noted that we had a large tent when booking in addition to having child and infant. The campground placed us with a large pad, beautiful tall trees at the background, and pretty close to the bathroom.  Can't ask for a better site for our family.  Customer service, they responded to my email query about fire ban and propane fire pit within couple hours and were courteous.",
      "Negatives:\nThere's more permanent residents there than campers. The Frisbee golf doesn't exist, all that's left are a few numbers on trees. The waste hook-ups are badly designed, who's idea was it to set them 1 foot above ground? Kinda defeats the point of hooking your RV up to them as you have to go out and empty the pipe making sure you don't splash poop on yourself. Speaking of poop, there was dog poop everywhere. \nPositives:\nThe view from the park is awesome. It's quite a big campground and it has full hook-ups.",
      "Totally overpriced for an inexistant service ! The showers are cold, no privacy at all, it just looks like  a big parking lot, and this for more than 45$ ! And on the top of that, you have to pay 11$ extra per day if you want wifi, and there online reservation doesn't work ! The laundry facilities were all not working when we got there... \nGenerally extremely disappointed ! \nSo if you were planning to stay for the night, think about it again, and better check around what's still available.",
      "Never stayed and never will even think about it again. I cancelled 8 days prior to arrival due to forest fires and the road in from our arrival destination was closed. They refused to refund me my money. I would have been better off cancelling the day prior. I would have gotten some sort of refund then. I was trying to be courteous so they could book out our site sooner...They are crooks as far as I'm concerned. I'm sure we were not the only people that cancelled and they were trying to save their profits for the season because of all the fires."

Campground owner is extremely nice and accommodating, he let us stay in his field across the street from the campground because we had a large trailer and wouldn't fit in any of the sites.

It's the worst we've ever experienced in a campsite!\n The power outlet is at the front of the stall?.....you will need an extra cord to reach it, at least it was that way for our stall. The person working though, was great and got us a cord to reach the outlet. We tried to book elsewhere while we were there but of course, every place was booked on late notice. Don't stay in the North stalls, the road ways in front of the stalls are gravel, very dusty, no one slows down. The other road ways are paved!",

She blamed us for breaking her underground after pipe and wouldn't let us park our truck beside our camper and when we were leaving she followed us around the rv park in her truck swearing at us . The final straw was when I confronted her and tried to reason and she told me to go f&$@ myself and drove off.

Leaves from the campground takes  a group of 4-5 ($250 p/p) north along the Mitchell River so you can see the coast line. Then back along the river towards the falls passing a number of smaller falls and lands at Mitchell Falls. Have a swim before the 4km return walk over big Mertens Falls and under Little Mertens Falls is rock art. ",

      "Super nice campground with semi private spots to put tent and car. Host was very welcoming. Facility is quite new and there are a lot of hidden places to watch the sunset. Showers are nice, warm, and free! Recommend. Single downside is the somewhat long walk to the bathroom but that's absolutely worth it.",
      " An amazing place... with friendly atmosphere. You can camp with beautiful views of Atlantic ocean just from your tent or caravan. We rented a little boat and make a little cruise around the coast.",
      "We had a very nice stay at this camp site. The view is great and the owner was very friendly. Also important, the shower facilities were new and very good. I would certainly recommend a visit.",
      "Very friendly and service oriented owner. New and clean bathroom/shower/kitchen in the service building. No wastewater disposal, but possible to empty toilet tanks. Great place for tents. Access to the ocean, but no beach. Close to Bergen.",
      "Very nice place, but the tent fields didn't have electricity and were very muddy (Huge rain storms might have had an effect).\n\nThe toilets were very clean, but there were not many. 1 toilet for each gender and 2 gender neutral toilets at the kitchen. \n\nThe showers were very nice, unlimited showering, very warm and clean. But again there weren't many, 2 for each gender. Same with the sinks. \n\nFishing place was nice, a lot of mackerel to be caught on a nice dock.\n\nThe Wi-Fi is only available near/inside a nice warm and cozy cabin. The cabin is nice when raining because it's warm. WiFi is quite fast.\n"

      "Turned up on a rainy day after arriving late one night. Was told too dangerous to camp due to the rain. Had to search for a last minute campsite, luckily found somewhere else thank goodness. A call or message to tell us in advance would have been nice (and courteous).",
      "After reading some of the reviews I was a little reluctant to camp here easter bank holiday weekend.  However.  No issues at all. The owner was very friendly and helpful and accommodated us as best as she could.  As there are no designated drive on pitches and I have a T5 with vango awning tent.  So she took down some barriers for me so I was able to set up.  The bathroom / wash / toilets are very clean and the shower was awesome and spacious.  I would definitely stay here again.  The town centre is only a 15 / 20 min walk away. We had our two boys 10 and 7yrs old who loved it.  They where allowed to play football and have a run about.  We did the water fall trail and it was awesome. The camp site is on a very busy road but it didn't bother us at all.  ",
      "Awful. Booked a plot for the weekend and got turned away at 9pm because it was too wet to camp, no prior warning despite leaving contact details when booking. Had to drive halfway round Yorkshire to find somewhere else. Avoid this place.",
      "A small site with toilets and showers just off the main road so lot's of traffic noise",
      "I called and asked could I use the toilet on way through. The owner was polite and let me use it for free. I checked out the facilities and found them clean and useable. I also checked out the field, nice and flat well cut grass. Very cheap too. Only downside is near to the main road but the field does go back a bit. I will be staying here when next up in the area. The one negative reviewer is nuts if you ask me. Bringing all of his friends and kids to have a barbeque and play football, and expecting them all to use it for free, what do you expect? Not fair on other guests who deserve some peace."

      "What an absolute super caravan and camp site High Laning is. My wife and I have spent a lot of camping at Mr & Mrs Taylor Camp site and cannot fault it.  Well done team Taylor.",
      "We found the owner to be rude and unhelpfull. The pitch was very soft. She tried to get us really close to the camper next to us even though the field was empty. We were told there was TV reception but there wasn't. She charged us extra for the dog then told us not to let the dog out. There is no phone data reception. We paid extra for electric but it went off at 8.55am with no warning.We called this The Ten Commandments site because of all Don't  Do Notices of which there are many. The facilities were very basic ie, washing up in the ladies toilet and only one shower 20p. I gave one star because the scenery was spectacular.",
      "Very friendly service, the dryer is a little expensive and some of the showers are a little cool (use the electric ones). Other than that, great!",

The village is a really nice with two friendly pubs the George and dragon has some very nice local brewed ales ,we will going back again and would recommend a visit .",

Basic washing up facilities with water heater reaching only one of the 2 sinks. Look forward to returning when improvements made.",

The new owners are friendly , polite and so welcoming , nothing is an issue if you require any kind of help.The facilities and the grounds  are kept clean and tidy. The prices are great and they are not hiked through the roof like other sites. A couple of minutes walk and your in Reeth with a few pubs , shops etc and the pice of a beer is reasonable to. I will return here soon to do a bit more hiking and because of the owners hospitality   - Ian and his family do a great job and the surrounding area stunning .",
      "Great little campsite, would of give it five stars if the toilets had better facilities for washing and shaving, also no hot water but did have a shower. The site has recently been taken over so maybe these issues will be addressed. I would definitely recommend this site and with the village a five minutes walk away with some lovely pubs it's why I have gone back over the last few years.",

      "We stayed in a single room at the \"motel\". Im sorry to say but unfortunately a horrible stay.  The beds were super uncomfortable, it was loud from the outside doors opening and people running around (paper thin walls?), it felt dirty, the toilets were discusting, broken lights in the hallway between the kitchen and the rooms.\nGood thing was the free parking and wifi.",
      "Very poor site. Only redeeming feature is the use of the free laundry facilities which unfortunately appear to be in constant use by the sites permanent residents. Hard ground so difficult to put up the awning. Toilets not cleaned regularly. Location on the edge of an industrial estate which is currently undergoing construction. We moved on after one night."

      "Not impressed we were'nt told  that we couldn't get back into the caravan site with the car after 2330. Had to leave car in the late arrivals area. \nThe pitch sizes were not big enough for a caravan, awning and car to be parked, surely this is against regulations!\nThe showers, although lovely and clean, sprayed out in a cone shape and got everything in the cubicle wet, except me!!",
      "This is a very clean and friendly site theres plenty of room and very good play areas for the kids we had a very good long weekend here and will be going back next year \nThis site is very secure  with AMPR cameras so unless your cars on it u wont get in 5***",
      "the older women who serves you at this place is the most rudest woman I have ever met from booking over the phone to serving you in person she is so abrupt and has a major attitude problem. also the pitch is not level. the mini golf is very poor. the golf clubs are so old they break. and then the owner acuses you of breaking them and and won't give you the £5 deposit back. money spinner. the shop prices are high and the other staff are not so friendly either. on the plus side the toilet block is clean.. that's about it. can't understand the 5stars.",
      "We received a friendly welcome on our arrival. All caravan/motorhome pitches were gravelled and clearly defined and not too close to your neighbours. Toilet block was always clean (even on a day when we had torrential rain all day!). Site was well cared for and maintained. Great dog walking area in an upper field which gave good views of the surrounding countryside. People around the site were pleasant and friendly. The shop stocked a wide range of items but they were expensive. Not far to go to Helmsley (3.5miles) and to visit Riveaux Abbey or Terrace. Both lovely."

      "We visited this site over august bank holiday weekend with a touring caravan. First impressions were that the site was very compact. Our pitch was on a steeply sloping hill with a very narrow service road which made it really tricky to site the caravan. The pitches also felt very tightly packed in.\n\nThe site itself appears to be well managed. It's clean and tidy and the staff seem to be helpful.\n\nThere's a small football court with artificial grass that keeps children entertained along with a playground an a zip line. Note: this makes it a good site for families with young children, perhaps less so for those looking for tranquility.\n\nNote for those visiting with a caravan: there are three routes to the entrance to the site, two of which are \"unsuitable for caravans\"! Take the route that comes from the northern side (down Birkland Lane from Sunniside)\n\nThis site has its positives:\n- great for families with young children\n- great location for visiting Beamish museum\n\n... And its negatives:\n- hilly\n- expensive (showers are on top of the high pitch fee, kids are extra)\n- high pitch density",
      "Stayed recently in the pods and enjoyed every minute of it with friends and family. Only downside was the arrogant old woman who talked down to you and thought she was better than anyone. The comments she made to my partner and friends really were not acceptable ( plot s42 i believe she stayed in )",
      "Looked clean, tidy and quiet whilest we visited Monday morning, I was surprised how many statics there were x",
      "Well kept site with great staff who couldn't do enough for you. The prices are a bit steep for the facilities on offer compared to other sites I've been on but there are so few in this area. Be warned that if you like to leave the site and you don't have a vehicle then you'll have to be pretty fit to get up the hill to the local pub (which is way more than 400 metres away btw).",

      "Fantastic location for Hadrian's Wall. The park was in a lovely, peaceful rural setting. The motor home sites were a bit closer together than some of the other sites we have visited. The ladies amenities block was very good with two complete \"bathrooms\" included. Also, showers were free and had a constant water flow with normal tap. Thumbs up for that! The only issue I had was the chemical loo disposal point was located right outside the amenities block in full view rather than in a discrete location...but they did have a hand sanitiser, which is always a plus.",
      "Friendly, clean, well maintained and in a great location for wall country.  Just off the 69 so really easy to get to. A very good campsite all \nEven better are the kids play area, feeding time for the animals twice a day and amount of play space around the site. \nThoroughly deserved 5 stars. ",
      "Stopped here for two nights on the way back from Scotland. Wished I had just drove an extra 5 hours so I didn't need to. Yes the shower block is nice but if you want to pitch a tent like I did this place is best avoided. Most of the tent pitches are on a slope which is ridiculous. We were put on the accessible pitch located right next to the bathrooms. It was flat but very noisy and busy. Loads of screaming kids!! Sauna was out of action but when I saw the price i wouldn't of used it anyway. So if you want to sleep on a slope surrounded by screaming kids this is the perfect place. If not, avoid!",
      "This was the 4th time we'd been tent camping here. We like walking Hadrien's Wall and this campsite is perfect for a particularly nice stretch. It has very good facilities and is well managed. Close to the small town of Haltwhistle too should you need provisions. It is ideal, hence we keep going back.",
      "Amazing facilities, immaculate showers, toilets, even 2 baths in the ladies block! Lovely playground for the kids. We camped here-tent pitches are very close together and only have views of other tents/caravans. Neighbours were noisy-one prat woke the whole campsite up at 6am blowing up his air bed with an electric pump! Others had dvd players on loudly at 11pm. I think the rules about noise should be dictated a little bit more as at other campsites. There is no space for young  kids to play near the tent, just other tents and the gravel road. I would definitely return to this campsite to glamp in a wigwam, but wouldn't camp here in a tent again."

      "This place is ok as a base camp. The caravan was clean but didn't have the right utensils for doing any major cooking, or even lighting the cooker. Each caravan could do with its own parking space, making visitors parking separately. There needs to be a strict noise ban between certain times. The place is still full of chavs.\nBut on the plus side the area was kept clean. The beach is on your doorstep as well as many local walks. So much to do and very little time. We will definitely be using this park again.",
      "Just spent a 2 night weekend with our tourer at Crimdon Dene. The reception staff were very pleasant and helpful and the ground staff on the touring site were very helpful also. The grounds are kept very nice and clean but the toilets could do with a little updating. The location of the touring site is good but I think the pitches could be a little bigger especially if you want to erect an awning. The entertainment complex is good but is a little small on a busy Saturday night.\nDrinks prices are as usual very expensive but all parks like this are!\nOne thing I would suggest is that it should have somewhere like an onsite fish shop or takeaway so you can get something to eat after you come out of the pub.\nAll in all, I would try the site and reserve judgement on your own experience rather than the bad reviews on here. We enjoyed it and will definitely return.",

      "Overall a pretty decent experience considering the price; The caravan itself was well presented. The location of the park provides easy access to the beach and coast; which allows for some awesome photos. The park itself is well managed and kept tidy. A Nisa shop is located in the center to allow you to buy the majority of items you'll need; and at a (reasonable) decent price. The family entertainment at the \"Complex\" was \"Okay\" - Some staff members let the show down; although others make up for they flaws. The price of drinks/food are seriously overpriced (£3.60/Carling)."

      "I love staying at the Hideaway. It's so peaceful and there is an adults only section so you can enjoy the quite of a good book. \n\nThe facilities are amazing with an on site breakfast van selling freshly ground coffee and croissants. There is a site shop selling all sorts for camping gear to kids sweets. \n\nBarney the owner is a great guy and always up for a chat when you pop in for some milk. \n\nThis is such a lovely campsite that we frequent a lot, just for a little get away. ",
      "Enjoyed our stay at this campsite.\n\nThere are many great points about this campsite, including the amazing facilities which are very clean and high quality. We enjoyed the no kids plots after a week at another campsite being woken up early each day.\n\nDue to its popularity the grass was long gone at many of the plots. We had to pitch on bare earth which meant the tent needed cleaning at home as it was covered in clumps of mud when we took it down.\n\nOverall I'd recommend this site.\n\nTip: There's a garden centre on the way out of Easingwold that sells logs at half the price.",
      "As camping sites go, this one is of a very high quality. Immaculately maintained with plenty of space between spots. They even let you have fires!!! (I've no idea why others sites don't do this).\n\nLot's to go at within the local area (totally recommend Piglets Farm if you have young kids).\n\nIt's a place we love going back to.",
      "We spent a week here in March, and it is a fantastic place. lovely surroundings and the toilets and cleaning room are very clean and tidy! there is a park a short distance from the campsite. only 15 minutes into Ripon. The campfire`s are a great touch, we literally lived off BBQ and marshmallows while we were here. I would advise taking some wood along with you. Buying this from the hideaway can get expensive if you have a fire bug for a partner. £10.00 for two bags and we go through that in an evening. recommended this place to all our friends and family and will be returning in September for another week away.",
      "Lovely camp site, good facilities and location. Nice sized pitches. Providing a wheelbarrow to transport items to pitch is a nice thoughtful touch and much appreciated.  My only slight negative comment would be only 1 hairdryer, so had to wait to dry hair, but apart from that excellent site."

Its clean with hot water, electric, and somewhere for the kids to play come rain or shine and a view you would never tire of. If you've not been then you're missing out on a wonderful place to go for a break.  Perfect.",

After packing down on the Sunday and going for a long walk, we returned early evening to ask if we could use the dog shower following an unpleasant incident with our dog.

We look forward to returning in the future.",

      "Really lovely friendly welcome on our arrival. Facilities shown to us and we were given a choice of pitches for our motorhome. Site is in a beautiful location. Well cared for and maintained site with a lovely atmosphere. Can walk to nearby Haltwhistle across the fields on public footpaths- beware though as they are not always easy to see. Also able to walk to Hadrian's Wall. Buses run from all of the historical sites along the wall and drop you about half a mile from the campsite. Toilets and showers were warm and clean.  Would definitely recommend!",
      "The facilities are good for a campsite (apart from the drying room) however if you get bad weather and you are situated near the entrance you will get a mud bath. We arrived and part of our pitch was already muddy from the previous campers, this became liquid mud. This was the second time we had used this site as we wanted to enjoy the beautiful countryside around the area but the same stated problem happened again. The people who own it are great but they seriously need to put some form of ground drainage in on the lower camping area. I want to to say it's good but the persistent muddy camping area near the entrance means I can't. ",
      "I am very happy with the Hadrians Wall Campsite and the facilities it offers (shower/toilet block, laundry, fridge/freezer, dish washing area, water filling, chemical toilet facilities and a lovely little shop/cafe that provides a pizza to your pitch before certain time of night). I have found all the staff very helpful and friendly and they are really nice to chat to, they can tell you anything you need to know about the area. There is leaflets for places to visit, a map of the area also. A very good camp site with most of the things you would need if just walking in from the many walks around Hadrian's Wall. They also have numerous pets and wildlife tgat just are so friendly that the birds come to your tent door and jump in for breadcrumbs!  I will definately come back again!",

I lovely walk takes you along the river into the quaint Village..  sadly no play area for kids but as we don't have any it didn't affect us.  We will be back ..",
      "Stayed here for 5 nights at the end of august for our first camping trip as a family of 4. Despite some other review saying it was hard to find, our sat nav took us straight there. \nUpon arrival we were greeted and shown where our plot was. I was really surprised to see what a huge space you were given, meaning we didn't have to worry about our little ones invading other people's space when they were playing. Our pitch was right next to the river which was lovely to wake up to each morning. \nThe toilets and showers were always immaculately clean. 50p charge for a shower, but this was plenty of time and the water was always hot. \nGreat location, lots around to see and do. \nAm not worried that if we camp again other sites won't live up to this standard! \nWill definitely return",

Stunning riverside location. the place seems short of bins but maybe I should have asked lol toilets and showers are spotlessly clean, so much so that I couldn't believe it!

Even though we had a estate car with  a airbed in \"Campacar\" Think £15 is very expensive means fridge didn't even have a door on it.\nShowers was dirty no toilet paper. First aid box was empty. \nAnd there's a VERY  pompous arrogant noisy touring caravan man & his stuck up wife or what ever it is..Staying all year on site. \n\n who stays on site who has nothing better to do but interfere and watching every move we made.\nWho dictated to me that the campsite\n DOES NOT ALLOW BBQ....Lol\n W.T.Hell. No BBQ.\nYes the old senile owner said ..That He Does Not Want to upset his pompous friend...\n .So\n\n.We left the site with my £15  As we was stopped by the pompous touring caravan dick man .As he informed the senile old man who is supposed to own the site, And is no were to be seen around the site all day long.So if you have a problem then there's no body there to help you. \n\nWe ended up in a lovely site for the same money which I must say was 5 Star  .Very friendly and half a mile from Tenby.

      "Best Camping Ever !!! \n\nWe booked by phone, and the staff was really cute and nice.\nOur pitch was just in front of the sea: the view was incredibly beautiful ! Best location ever. The bathroom bloc is spacious and clean. The camping is really calm and the ambiance is peaceful. There's a lot of walk around the camping which was really cool. \nThe staff was absolutely adorable and really helpful. \nWe will be back !!",
      "We have stayed here a number of times and have nothing but praise. A wondetful scenic location and a well maintained and clean site.",
      "Great place. Clean, well maintained and friendly staff. Fantastic views of the sea.",
      "Wow, what a lovely place! Outstanding views from the Eden Lodge. Very modern accommodation with an amazing hot tub! Even small extras made a difference such as the small music speakers you could plug your phone into! Service was excellent.\n\nThe only reason this is not a 5 star review is due to the following:\n\n-We only got to use the hot tub for 2 nights! The hot tub was freezing the night we arrived. While I appreciate they have to clean it out and refill it and let it heat up, its not fair that you pay for 3 nights stay and only get to use it for 2. Perhaps they should look into either a faster heating Jacuzzi or some heating element to warm it up.\n\n-We didn't get a welcome hamper/basket! One wasn't ready when we arrived, so we were told one would be brought to us shortly, which is fine. But we never got one...\n\nOther than those two points, the stay was absolutely fantastic!",
      "Great location and views, fantastic facilities (especially for families). Only issue was that the showers were much too hot and you can't adjust the temperature."

      "Firstly, the shower and toilet block is the best I have seen anywhere. Each shower is in a room big enough for the average family and is a wet room with shower, toilet and hand basin. The standard of cleanliness and fittings would not be out of place in a very good hotel. Secondly, the setting. Wow. Right on top of the cliff overlooking the beautiful Three Cliffs Bay. Thirdly, the wardens. Nothing is too much trouble. They are endlessly friendly and happy to help. The weather can get a bit Welsh, so expect some wind and rain - the walkway up to the shop and reception can get rather boggy underfoot. Will be going back next year.",
      "What a great place to camp. The view is second to none.  You could almost believe you were on a desert island.  But be warned don't pitch your tent to close to the edge of the cliff.  If the wind picks up expect to watch it blow away.  the wash block is 5* standard  fully tiled, electronically operated showers, under floor heating  very clean and tidy  ",
      "This place is amazing. The views are fabulous and the pitches are well spaced apart.the shower facilities are the best I've ever come across and has a lovely shop on site.\nWell worth traveling from Forfar in Scotland.\nFirst Class site well worth giving it the five star review",
      "Best campsite I've been to so far. WC/Shower block is excellent with plenty of self contained WC / Shower / wash hand basin cubicles, ideal for families and the heated floor is great, even in the summer... The place is very well maintained, I felt bad driving over the grass it was that immaculate. Shop caters for most things (food and equipment).  Lovely beach within 15-20 mins walking distance and nice views of either the bay one side or countryside on the other. It is quite an exposed hilltop location (hence  the views) so make sure your tent is man enough for the job, we had a few split poles from the winds and others fared a lot worse. Would return.",
      "Excellent campsite.  Lovely views across Three Cliffs Bay.  Shower block is amazing with fully tiled individual bathrooms with sensor controlled showers. (and plenty of them so no queuing) .  Grass is always kept short and gardens tidy.  Wardens are really friendly and laid back including the owners. Dogs allowed and fire pits can be hired so really a good old fashioned non-commercial site with 5 star facilities.  An absolute gem in a beautiful location."

      "We stayed in the 9 person surf cabin last month and had mixed reactions. Firstly, don't be deceived by the photos, the cabins are tiny! There are 3 double bunk beds, one single and one other double at the top, which although is a clever use of space, the reality of having 9 people squeezed into such a small area was a little difficult. When researching the trip, the photos made it look like a long cabin (reasonable size looking for 9 people) but unfortunately what is not made clear from the photo, one cabin is a very small portion of this. We shared a balcony with several other parties and the 'BBQ for 40 people' was in fact a couple of bricks. A few extra costs that we weren't expecting were a little disappointing, for example you have to pay extra to bring another car, which seems unfair for when you are paying for a 9 person cabin, surely you should be allowed the equivalent amount of car! The staff were variable in their friendliness but were generally quite rude. The all you can eat breakfast (which they advertise at the wrong price) is very much average. \nLocation was pretty good. Easy drive to a few places but be prepared for the walk down to the beach as it is on a busy road and on a fairly steep hill. Woolacombe, the town itself, is lovely.",
      "Was clean,But being so close to other people  who didn't have children then decided to have a argument til early hours put you off returning plus TV didn't work could do with seating inside and tables it looked more like hostels then cabins inside come home a day earlier aswell",
      "Great for holiday with a dog. Friendly staff. Really helpful. We got the accomodation wr have seen after a slightly mix up. Everybody loved my dog and this place is great to bring your dog. Now the cons: the hygiene in most of tje showers is not the best. The breakfast is ok and reasonable price. But the sausages and the toast is too greasy. ",
      "Lovely site with great views.  Friendly and helpful staff.  The breakfast and evening meals are freshly cooked and use locally sourced ingredients.  \nLooking forward to returning again.",
      "Had an amazing time, great location, and friendly staff, really impressed with the breakfast. Only let down was the price in the bar, but that's no reason not to go for a well priced getaway, just take some tinnies "

No airs or graces, no games room or pool. Just perfect pitches and amenities. Get off the grid and enjoy your stay",

The laundry room with fridge and freezer available for everyone to use is a really nice touch and extremely helpful if like us you are camping.\n\nI had a quick look inside one of the static caravans available to hire when the owners kindly let me swap reading books and it was lovely inside, nothing like the static caravans I've seen elsewhere and almost enough to tempt me away from my tent!\n\nThanks for a great stay and I'm sure we'll be back later in the year."

With so many pitches it's great for the single traveller and groups of families and friends alike.

Electricity and wifi are also offered, for those that still desire some basic home comforts! The on site shop has many essentials at extremely reasonable prices. Local towns offering shops and restaurants are only a short drive away as too are the beaches.

There is a quieter family field. As the camping season draws to a close the field with electric hook up is closed. Obviously it is next to Llangennith world class beach which accounts for the campsites popularity.   The shop is open during the summer and the cafe is open most of the year round. Decent food, suitably priced but feels slightly canteeny but with excellent views.",

The children enjoyed going down to the park and we felt it was safe enough to let them go down by themselves and we could see them from where we were pitched, they also enjoyed having the space to kick a ball and run around. The clubhouse was nice to visit, we were able to charge our mobiles and access WiFi for free there and the children enjoyed the games room. Staff were amazing especially the cleaning lady who I think comes to clean the facilities in the morning and afternoon and does a very good job in keeping the facilities there clean, always smiling and happy to chit chat with you. \nThe weather was not fab for most of our stay which dampened the atmosphere a bit but that has not put us off returning in the near future. The views are beautiful\n\nWhat I would love to see is more options in the game room for the children. \n\nIt would be great if the club house could offer a simple food menu in the evening. \n",

Flies having the time of their lives around the place.\n\nPrice:\nPrices raise by unacceptable amounts each year. Despite the company gaining more abd more visitors, they still make the prices higher... They charge ridiculous amounts for their horrible showers and their bins.",

Unfortunately the touring field has no drainage, has no facilities for motorhomes. guess it needs a good upgrade and overhaul. Hope they will do this soon. Had a fab wknd whilst there weather was good so no flooding.",

      "Total disgusting place and people who work there.  Paid £1000 deposit on February for my caravan to be sited took my caravan up in the march told I could finsh paying the rest by the end of July.  We never spent 1 night in the carvan due to a family death and my car was unfortunately stolen so at the end of june we as a family decided it was best to sell the carvan and the pitch as it wasn't being used I informed butty lands manger Joanne this was my intension who told me this was not allowed they then went on to remove my carvan from my pitch put it in there car park and sold my pitch on stealing my £1000 so will be taking butty land to a small claims court.  They r trying to use a joke of a contract as an argument for there cause but am so sure any court in the land will see this for what it is. A total joke"

      "Not sure about the camping sites, but the cabins were absolutely filthy. Thick layers of dust was all around everything. It was as if no one had stayed for the whole winter, and they didn't bother to clean it up before. \n\nSpent an hour cleaning before it was livable. Hot water supply was also terrible, taking up more than hour to get some warm water.\n\nDefinitely would not recommend.",
      "Dette var stusselige greier! Vi har bodd på mange små og enkle campinghytter opp gjennom åra, men det er første gang jeg har opplevd en hytte totalt rensket for utstyr. Greit nok, det står i omtalen av hyttene hvis man leiter, helt nederst på siden, men det synes ikke når man bestiller. Man kan \"låne\" felles kjk utstyr fra et kjipt lite servicebygg - 2 tallerkener, 2 skåler, skjeer, gafler, ingen kniver, et par ok kjeler, én bøyd fjøl. Som åtte hytter skal dele på... De skal også dele på én do og én dusj. Hvor det var tomt for oppvaskmiddel på kvelden, tomt for dopapir om morgenen, blafrende lyspære på do og svak sparepære i dusjen. Det er spart på absolutt alt alle steder, og man føler seg ikke særlig velkommen. Ikke engang en vannkanne på deling kunne vi finne. Og ja, man kan gå 100-150 m til et annet servicebygg, men det frister ikke spesielt mye når det regner og er tidlig morgen. \nMye hadde vært bedre om man fikk ordentlig info ved bestilling om at hytta er enkel. Og kjøp inn fire ganger så mye kjøkkenutstyr og ha ekstra dopapir, tørkepapir, såpe osv stående! Det blir kanskje noe svinn men da slipper man sure anmeldelser som denne. På den positive siden var hytta romslig, billig, sengene var ganske gode og hun i resepsjonen var veldig hyggelig og ga god info om området.",
      "Du får hva du betaler for. Kom til en kald å rå hytte. Måtte skru på all varmen for å tørke opp hytta. Sanitær bygget var så nedslitt å ekkelt at noen dusj på morran ble det ikke. Nettstedet lover kjøkkenutstyr som ikke eksisterte i vår hytte, Wi-Fi ja, men så dårlig at det var ingen vits å bruke. Anbefales til de som trenger et sted å sove før turen går videre neste dag.",
      "Helt ok camping med mulighet for tur og bading. Hyggelig resepsjonist. Finn utsikt mot fjell og øyer. \n\nHytta som vi bodde i var litt slitt, men deilig med to rom. Det er komfyr og kjøkken inne og det er køyesenger. Felles toaletter og dusj. \n\nMinus stjerne for at man må hente kjøkkenutstyr et annet sted og det kan være opptatt. Ingen kaffetrakter. ",

No problem with amount of toilets or showers, although you will have to press the button for shower every second, really annoying. They also have a bar and cafe which are both quite nice.",

Paying with a 10 kroner coin for 10 min. would be better! Otherwise a nice place with all facilities for caravans as well as backpackers. Maybe a bit too crowded"

The animals are nice to see around the place and the views were nice, shame about the rubbish piled up near the toilets and manky sofas under a 'tiki' hut. Everything looked like it had seen better days and had been painted in quirky colours to try to cover this up. Two stars for the location close to Lizard point and the view.",

Not for your manicured lawns/big shower block camper and definitely not glampers! ",

The facilities are well thought out and so brilliant to have an on site cafe. The chickens and ducks wandering around felt idyllic and chicken hugging in the evening was a real highlight! Will definitely be returning to this beautiful campsite!",
      "We stayed here for a week and had a great time. Little Trethvas is centrally located so it's a perfect starting point to explore the Lizard Peninsula and its beautiful coast and villages. Owner Liz is very knowledgable about the area and gave us a lot of useful tips as well as very warm welcome. Camp has family feel and good facilities. Especially enjoyed new bathrooms and local cafe' serving delicious full english breakfast. We loved resident animals, Afro dude with his cute hairdo, ducks and chickens, always sticking together, always terribly busy and funny. It was our first visit to Cornwall, but will definitely return. Little piece of paradise.",

      "Terrible service. They were very rude (especially the owner). Not professional at all.  Facilities were just OK-ish.\nDoes not worth it. There are better options around there, cheaper and with much better staff, services, and facilities.\n\n---------\nWe called many times before going. Nobody answered. We arrived there and called the number that was written in the reception. Again, nobody answered. We talk to the owner. He was very rude and was not helpful at all. We had to leave and look for another place to stay.\n\nWe call them in the following days to complain and ask for a REFUND. They hung up the phone. We call again from other mobile, they didn't pick up. Of course, we did not get any refund, and not even a sorry.\n\nThey are awful. seriously.",
      "Absolutely horrible experience. We booked online and called numerous times to confirm our reservation, however Chy Carne never responded. We got to the campsite and there was no one there. We spoke with the owner who was terribly  rude and basically told us to pitch the tent and mind our own business.\nWe ended up leaving and looking for alternative accommodation. I called them the day after and the just hung up on me.\nDo not go to this place!!!!!!",
      "We arrived at the place and there was no one at the reception. We tried to call them several times and no one answered. We had to find a better accommodation for that night. The day after we tried to call them again, asking for an explanation and for a refund, but they never called us back. We lost money and time.\nHorrendous experience!",
      "As much as liked the location, friendly staff my my holiday was completely ruined when they moved my tent  (including all my stuff)  without even asking me. I was given option to pitch anywhere. I pitched my tent in a nice location. On the third day I received a phone call telling me that I have pitched in the wrong location. I mentioned that I was told that I can pitch anywhere specifying the name of the person whom I spoke to.  The assured me that they will speak to her and call me back. I did not receive any phone call. \n\nI came back that evening and found out that they have moved my tent with all our stuff in it. I have been camping across UK for last eight years and never read or heard about anything like this. Decided to cut short my trip and leave next morning. \n\nThey have at least shown the courtesy to  apologise and refund me. However that does not anyway compensate for a ruined holiday. ",

      "We have just returned from a 6 night stay at Little Trevothan and it is a little piece of paradise. Ideally situated to visit all that Cornwall has to offer. A short 20 minute stroll to Coverack where you can visit the little shops and restaurants, I can highly recommend The Paris for dinner or just a beer watching the sunset over the harbour.\nThe site is maintained beautifully and our caravan was spotlessly clean, Mark and Sue and there children Jackie and Dave are really welcoming and can't do enough to help.\nTo sit out in the evening and look at the all the stars is an amazing sight.\nWe will definitely be back as soon as we can.",
      "We loved our week at Little Trevothan camping site. The children loved the games room and the park. The site was clean and well maintained. The new owners were so friendly and couldn't do enough to help...even helping us when our car battery went through running an electric fridge off of it. The showers were free and warm. Lovely little shop selling all essentials. Loved how the fields were hedged off giving it a cosy feel. Lots of beautiful and interesting local sites to visit. Will definitely go there again! Thank you for a lovely memorable week at your last lovely campsite",
      "Having stayed 5 times at this site in the last 4 years it had  become a home from home. I was a little nervous this year due to the change in ownership. Within 30 minutes of arriving I realized that it was business as usual. Nothing was too much trouble for the new owners, Mark and Sue, and as I have said many times, this is the best site that I have ever stayed on and I shall continue to visit in the future. Can't wait till next year.",

      "A nice holiday park. Could do with a refresh. The restaurant was not very good. Staff were very pleasant. Amazing views. Very hard working entertainment crew. Kids loved it.",
      "Great park with pool, golf, entertainment for adults and children, kids club, playground all overlooking the sea. The food was basic in the restaurant and fish shop/ takeaway. Pay a bit more and have one of the newer caravans with patio doors as older ones are okay but in need of a makeover. Friendly staff all over the site, would stay again.",
      "The caravan was clean and served purpose of being a base to get to local attractions. \nClub house needs a face lift and bar prices for alcohol seemed steep. \nThe entertainment wasn't great and didn't run to the time sheet we were given on arrival so was impossible to do specific things ie to keep toddler entertained. \nThe diving lesson in the pool (book at reception) was great value and our daughter thoroughly enjoyed herself!\nFriendly staff who are always willing to help.\nWould like to have stayed longer but wouldn't have been able to entertain our family on site for the day. \nOh and a healthy option on the take away menu would have been nice.",
      "Staff were very friendly and the caravan we stayed in was really nice, clean and modern. \n\nHowever, unless you're only looking for a relaxing caravan holiday with nothing much to do except walk on the coast, I wouldn't recommend this resort. \n\nThere's nothing around for miles. There's a small pub up the road but it was small and crowded and the facilities were disgusting. The bar on site is fine, but closes for 2 hours in the middle of the day for no apparent reason. \n\nThe on site restaurant is tiny and so requires pre-booking most nights. One night, we decided to eat there but the entire room was booked out by a birthday party so we had to resort to the 'takeaway' which just serves frozen fish and oven chips, and supermarket pizza. \n\nThe shop/off-license closes at 6pm so don't plan on going there to buy your self catering food if you've had a full day out. \n\nMy partner being a vegetarian also found it really difficult to find things to eat throughout the resort. \nThe closest supermarket is about 20 miles away so expect some long drives.\n \nThe beach is a short walk away but I wouldn't recommend this for a beach holiday. Dark sand, murky water and loads of seaweed on a fairly small beach. We went for a drive to Falmouth on one of the days, about half an hour away, and the beaches there were white with crystal clear water - a huge difference for so short a distance. \n\nAs mentioned before, if you're happy to sit in the caravan most days or go on coastal walks, this site is perfect, as long as you plan your food and drink well in advance. If you're looking for nice beaches, restaurants, bars and activities, I would recommend looking elsewhere",
      "If you are looking for a holiday somewhere rural but town and large supermarkets within 10 miles this is the place for you! I've been going here for over 8 years and my children have grown up with this site. Staff are welcoming and always remember us (and the children) ray the manager is happy to help with any problems. Will be coming here for years to come!"

      "Great place for camping for the family. Plenty to do and places to visit. Cornwall has an abundance of pretty areas and old fishing harbours. A must for all to experience. My only reason for not giving 5 stars was the cleanliness of the swimming pool and the serviced camping toilet block lacking in hand soap and toilet roll but other than that 4 stars top job😎🍻",
      "Been for a week in June.. had lovely weather and great time, helpful staff.. just beside one girl who took her job much too serious.. but aside of that.. no boredom.. but to get full of it you need a car.. area is beautiful and worth of exploring",
      "Great small family park. Yes it's dated, but for a sun holiday it's fine. Got caravan recleaned! Pool opening times were 10-12/2-4, soft play opening times were also bad considering it wasn't manned. However park was clean, staff helpful, food we thought was very good, free iced water for kids in bar. Great location to explore Cornwall. We had amazing weather.... ",
      "Previous reviews have put this place down, but, every single member of staff was friendly and most of all helpful, restaurant was perfect food every time we went  (3) arcade is big too, the only issue being the ticket machine that gives you receipts was 4 sided & only 1 worked, which meant CONSTANT queues. Entertainment was below average,  and a pint of cider was either £3.90 or £4.50. Pool small but good, kids play area ideal",
      "Great break. Van was comfortable and clean. We were fortunate to have a van on edge so quiet spot which suited us. Didn't use facilities much, as not our thing. Van would benefit from having a deck area. Reception looked tired and the park could do with a revamp. However we enjoyed it and had some fabulous days out. Seal sanctuary a must as is the beautiful kynance cove. "

      "We had a lovely few days at Trerise Farm. Nice and quite and the lovely Cornish weather was a bonus too.\n\nIm not sure where or who designed the showers, but they looked like something out of \"Grand Designs\", amazing. Never seen anything quite like them in all our years of camping. Superb. The site itself was very quite but I understand that was down to the campsite only opening for business a week or so before we arrived. Its dog friendly too which was great for us.\n\nWe did have one small issue though and that was our sat nav. It took through a few winding lanes. After a short time we found the more direct route.\n\nNote: The better route in is past the Goonhilly Satellite Earth Station, up to the crossroads, turn right. Head down for about a mile and you'll sign the signs on the right. Hope thats a helpful hint...."

The sea views looking over the rugged shoreline were amazing, with many a relaxing hour looking out for seals!\n\nThe beach below the campsite, Kennack Sands, was lovely with a little café to get ice-creams and coffee.\n\nThe site itself was very clean and well kept. The van we hired was a good size, with everything we could possibly need. The site shop was also well stocked. There was a lovely woodland walk on site. \n\nLocation wise the site is very near The Lizard and Lands End, and Newquay was only a short drive away too. A great location to explore Cornwall from.\n\nThanks Neil and Thea, see you again soon!",
      "We stayed a week in a cabin. We found it very nice ,clean , realy enjoyed it. The shower was brilliant  I usually find it difficult  to get in with avin to step over but this was a walk in one .. We will definitely be staying there again ",
      "Just had our second wonderful holiday this year at Gwendreath Farm Holiday Park at the end of October. We were really surprised as to how sheltered and warm the location is even at this late time of the year.\n\nThe caravan we rented had all the amenities and was fantastically situated overlooking the sea and beach at nearby Kennack Sands where we were able to enjoy the surfing. To add to the location the view of the sky at night was truly amazing!\n\nThe location of the campsite is within easy reach of many interesting places to visit such as the sleepy fishing village of Porthleven and the amusement park at Hollywell Bay. During our stay we went to the Lizard Point where we had a yummy cream tea with delicious Cornish cream! While we were there we were also fortunate to see seals off shore.\n\nThea and Neill the owners of the Park made us feel most welcome and were very helpful during our stay. The Halloween party that they organised for the families staying on the site was most enjoyable with lots of ghosts, witches and skeletons as well as plenty of fun and games for the children. \n\nWe will certainly visit again next year as we feel very relaxed and stress free there and there is still lots to see and explore!!"

      "Our family love this campsite. It is very relaxed and rustic with basic facilities. In our opinion it is what real camping is all about but it wouldn't be for everyone. If you like a picket fences plot with shiny showers then this isn't the place for you. If you like campfires under the stars with the chatter if families all around you till the late hours, then you will love it. Easy distance from the beach and supermarkets about 15 mins away. We didn't use the Cowshed bar but it looks like a fun place. ",
      "Celebrated my wedding here and had the best day ever. The staff are fantastic and made our day really special. Thanks to the cowshed our day couldn't have been any better 10/10. Thank you.",
      "Excellent campsite for family camping. Run by lovely people and has all the basic requirements. Campfires are allowed and the electric pitches are roomy and excellent value for money. ",
      "Just spent a great week there , its not for everybody . Pitch where you  like, weather  permitting , the staff and the pigs are very friendly. Highly recommended it for good basic camping.",
      "For a down to earth sort of campsite this is one to be recommended! \nThe site  itself is a big open expanse, with no 'fixed' pitches, except for the ones with electric hook up, and they are located on the upper side of the site.\nThe toilet and shower facilities are more than generous, being as these are covered within the pitch fees. \nThe on site pub / bar / club, has free wi-fi, and free device charging if you are a customer, which is a nice touch in an area that has a cell signal that is sometimes poor, and at other times good!\nWe did eat at the bar, an what can I say! The fish and chips was bloody gorgeous!\n\nIf your into a more laid back, less involved sort of site then this is one that you may want to consider. \n\nThe big negatives for me was the noise from the neighbouring site! And I'll make sure, from the neighbouring site! \nBack and for on their stupid ride on! all day long!! Like their staff can't walk, and then in to the evening, you get the comedy campsite attitude that the louder it is, then the more entertaining it is! Well it isn't! But sometimes you can't choose  your neighbours!!\n\nSo the plus is the freedom, do as you want! \n\nVersus the site regulation and the do as your told, of the neighbouring!\n\nWould I go back? HELL YES IS MY ANSWER!!"

      "Loved the location, the pitches and most of the facilities were good. However there can be an issue with parking in the small car park areas when the site is at capacity (as it seemed to be over bank holiday). The showers also leave a lot to be desired, one was broken, 4 would have no hot water when others were showering and the one electric with hot water's head had broken off. If the showers were in a better state this would be a 5 star review though, the shop, camp fire facilities and toilets were all in good condition",
      "Lovely campsite located 15 minutes from most major attractions in Stratford-upon-Avon. The pitches are just the right size, and as it was quiet we got to chose which pitch we wanted! The staff were lovely, and the honesty shop just proves the wonderful relaxed atmosphere. The only criticism I have is that the toilets could be more well lit as going at night with only a torch is not the best. They do have fairy lights in them but sometimes they don't work... Other than that I would recommend this campsite to anyone! ",
      "Cracking site, all amenities spot on and lovely and clean. Very peaceful, very picturesque and real fires on the pitches.\nOwner very friendly and helpful.\nI have been camping for 35 years, this site is either the best or very close to the best I have ever visited.",
      "One of my favourite camping spots. Small and basic but I like that. Really fire and watch the sun go down.",
      "Lovely campsite, really different from other ones we've been to over the years. The camping pitches are huge, each set in their own \"crop circle\" in a field of long grass. This setup means that each family or group gets their own private space set a little way apart from the other campers. The long grass can trigger allergies though so just be aware if you're susceptible. There's a friendly rooster (Trevor) who our kids loved playing with and petting, although I wasn't thrilled when he cockadoodled right outside our tent at 5am. The owner Mike was very friendly, as was Alicia who works there. Toilets and showers were clean, and there's a nice washing up and dining area in a huge shed. Cars aren't allowed on the camping field, which is great because it means that you don't need to worry about your kids getting run over, and also our kids loved riding in the wheelbarrow to/from the car to carry our tent etc to the field."

      "Ich war Ende Mai 2017 auf dem Campingplatz noch in der Vorsaison. Die Betreiberin ist eine ältere Dame die zwar kein Englisch spricht aber sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend ist. Es befinden sich insgesamt sechs Stellplätze für Wohnwagen bzw Wohnmobile auf dem Campingplatz der sehr gepflegt ist desweiteren gibt es diverse Sitzmöglichkeiten auf kleinen Camping Tischen mit Bänken dran. Die Duschräume sind einfach gehalten sauber und gepflegt, die Duschkabine selbst ist ein abgeschlossener Raum so dass nach dem Duschen die Wärme drin bleibt. Duschen kostet für ca 5 Minuten 10 Kronen. Zur Verfügung steht eine kleine Küche mit einem kleinen Herd und einem Ofen sowie Abwasch Möglichkeiten für Geschirr. Toilettenwasser kann kostenlos entsorgt werden nur das Nutzwasser muss mitgenommen werden da es hier keine Entsorgungsmöglichkeiten gibt. Für zwei Personen mit Caravan kostet die Übernachtung mit Strom 240 Kronen. Neben der Kochmöglichkeit steht eine Waschmaschine und ein Trockner die gegen eine kleine Gebühr benutzt werden können. Die Hauptstraße zum Platz befindet sich ca 350 m entfernt ist kaum hörbar und die Aussicht ist wirklich sehr gut. In weniger als 200 Meter Entfernung liegt ein großer See der über das Gelände gut zu erreichen ist"

      "Lovely welcome. Guys who manage this place are great people. They are not owners. Grounds well maintained.    Owners should invest in shower block!! Unfortunately, showers are VERY grotty. Desperately need updating. Shower drains 'back up, & you find yourself  paddling in 'used' water     uugghh.",
      "Great location to explore the area. Toilet block dated and in need of a serious deep clean. Site quite cramped when full, not alot of space between the caravans and tents. There is a small shop onsite but if you blink you miss it being open. Wouldn't stay here again.",
      "Very well laid out and organized, showers and toilet block kept nice and clean, nice big field to walk the dogs,shame they do not allow campfires would have been 5 stars if they did.",
      "The only good things about this campsite are the field and the location near Stratford-upon-Avon. Apart from that, the site is surrounded by park homes you have to drive through to get in. The facilities are probably built in the 70s and haven't been changed since. The cleanliness of the facilities is terrible. The dead spiders from weeks ago are still lying around. And nothing gets done about extremely noisy people who keep making noise until midnight.",
      "With hindsight, the warning signs were present on checking in when the wardens made no secret of the fact that they had moved from her native Plymouth as parks down there aren’t profitable enough – at least their motivation is clear.\nThe park is sandwiched in behind a residential mobile home park which is not apparent from the website and you have to walk through it to get to the dog walk, which is not close to the camping field, I’ll come back to dogs later.    The reception and shop building and separate toilet block are dated and unpleasant, with the single toilet block being at the far end of the field.  The gents had 2 cubicles (one with a broken lock), 3 urinals, 3 showers and 3 sinks which was completely inadequate for the size of the site.  They look as if they date from the 70’s and are ready for complete replacement.\nWe had a hardstanding pitch which was small and overlooked, and faced a wooden fence over the top of which were visible a number of units on the mobile home park about 6 feet away from us.\nWhile the site pretends to be dog friendly, it is not.  The dog walk is nowhere near the campsite.  Our dog, a 13 year old Labrador, has arthritis and the walk to the dog field took us about 15 minutes or so – he is a very slow walker.  He is also a male dog and anyone with a male dog knows they urinate a little to mark their territory.  According to the wardens, urinating against a hedge is not permitted on site and they appear to be living on a different planet if they seriously think no male dog on the site has ever cocked its leg until it got to the dog field.  Dog fouling relates to faeces, not urine.  I completely support policies relating to cleaning up fouling but have never heard of anyone thinking they can tell a male dog to cross its legs and wait until it is told to urinate on command!\nAs we were preparing to leave, our dog urinated against a hedge which prompted the female warden to appear from the office and ball across the site at the top of her voice at us that this wasn’t allowed.  She was followed a short time after by her partner who also balled at us in front of everyone that as we weren’t doing as we had been told we should leave.    I am hard pushed to decide whether their appalling conduct was down to racism, homophobia or that they are just deeply unpleasant people who have no idea how the hospitality industry works.\nThis is the worst camping experience I have suffered in 20 years of camping and there are so many better places than this."

      "Very clean & tidy campsite. Ready Camp tents are fully kitted out, very large, clean & warm! Site 2 minutes from Alton Towers, good playground, plenty of space to play ball games away from tents & separate dog walking area. Small shop on site, plenty of supermarkets within 15 minutes drive. Chippy van on Saturdays. Kids & adults had a fantastic week. ",
      "The staff are amazing, and very friendly. Extremely accommodating. \n\nThe site is lovely, and has plenty of space, and some fantastic walks nearby. \n\nAmenities could do with an update. Empty dispensers everywhere, and some broken taps mean it's a bit of a lottery when heading for a shower. I also couldn't find more than one area to empty water and toilets, as I wasn't given a site map. ",

Washing facilities and facilities for caravans. There is a separate family area with a lovely clear pitch with football nets. The owners are helpful and provide a easy to use map with local attractions on. A fire pit was a nice addition at a small cost.",

Busy weekend but quiter during the week, so you choose. Only intended to stay for a short break but ended up staying for the week. If ratings could go higher score would certainly double.",

      "Great site. I did some research beforehand so I was quite prepared for the hilly nature of the site. You're in a car so that doesn't really matter anyway. Great walks in the area and lovely that there isn't a Tesco supermarket 1 mile away bringing with it the trappings of urban living. This is, afterall, a rural location. Quite a chilly week weather wise but luckily we paid a little extra for a double glazed and centrally heated van. Not surprisingly, this proved to be a sound decision as we were all cosy and comfortable in the van. Do your research and enjoy this peaceful, picturesque park in a beautiful part of the English countryside. Highly recommended.",

What a lovely site and such a peaceful area and wonderful scenery. We are both looking forward to spending quality time at Wigley Orchard for years to come.",

The bathroom was quite tiny, certainly not large enough for two people at once. The shower was very powerful and hot, with an easy turn dial. There was a mini fridge, microwave, telly/dvd, and kettle. Cutlery and crockery can be hired from reception if you order takeaway from any of the places listed in the information pack.

Facilities were good, and what you'd expect for this style of site.  Having an electric hook-up was a bonus! \n\nThe owners are really helpful too and made us feel really welcome - thank you!",

The site is in an very peaceful part of the area, far enough off the main roads to keep noise down, but close enough to be extremely convenient. Highly recommended.\n\nThe high elevation and exposed field can be surprisingly chilly in colder months, so go prepared.",

Inadequate in my opinion.",
      "Fantastic little campsite, if you want to just get away from it all and relax! Lovely owner who greats you on arrival, giving you tips where to go and what facilities are close by. She encouraged our children to go meet the resident Sheep and pigs and go off exploring the acres of land around the camp field which they didn't need asking twice! Facilities are simple which is what you would expect for £18 per night (a pitch  for family of four with electric) but we didn't need anything more.  We normally go to campsites with a shop and park so thought the kids might complain but they loved it and said can we come again!  The showers were immaculately clean and yes you need a token (50p for 6 minutes) but there is a valid reason why they need to do that and we totally understood so wasn't an issue. Thank you Sarah and Whizz we will definitely be back x",

      "Viki Fjordcamping is a campsite with a beautiful view and is well maintained by the friendly owner. The sanitary facilities are decent, but with one major drawback: You have to pay for every drop of warm water. This includes the warm water you need to do your dishes and obviously the showers, although the latter is pretty normal in Norway. \n\nThe rest of the campsite is pretty basic and small, but you can use a rowing boat free of charge to discover the lake/fjord. Another thing to note, although we may just have been lucky, is that we weren't bothered by insects while we were there. This was a first for us during our stay in Norway. ",
      "Amazing campsite with a beautiful view on the second highest waterfall of Norway from every cabin. \nThe cabins are all well equipped and even have a small balcony. Wi-Fi worked easy.\nThe owner seems to come by every new arrival to chat for a bit and answer questions. Probably the best host we had on our whole trip. \nSomethings that might be helpful to know. There are two canoes, two small boats and a pedal boat free to use and you can rent a small motor boat. \nAll the cabins have a great view. I am not sure whether the view is as good of you cone by tent, since you are behind the cabins then. \n\nSomething for the owner. We enjoyed our stay very much and will definitely come back some day. 5 stars. One thing you could improve. The TV stand in cabin 9 and 10 is at an unclever height for tall people and has very sharp edges.  Unfortunately we had two people injured in two days, with one deeper cut on the forehead. If possible either put the tv stand higher or tape the edges. ",
      "Best view ever! Waterfall view with a rainbow. Small but really well attended camping with a spectacular view and for a great price. ",
      "Only downgrade is that the double bed is under a bunk and hemmed in by a wooden ladder which you can't move.  Other than that, great views an location",
      "Amazing place!  We stayed in cabin #2 and it was spectacular!!!!  The view and being right on the fjord was amazing.  We loved the clear deck and had every meal outside.  We just could not get enough of the view! The cabin is brand new and had everything you needed.  The 2 beds were very comfortable and the shower with heated floor was also very nice. \n The cabin/apartment is very modern and welcoming.  The owner even had the heater going before we arrived so we were welcomed by a cozy cabin.  The next morning I asked if he by chance had some sugar, salt and pepper and he delivered them within 10 minutes.  We went and visited Nigardsbreen and  Bergsetbreen within 20 minutes from the cabin and also enjoyed the Molden hike nearby.  The kids enjoyed the kayaks and we went out on the rowboat.  It was hard to leave this beautiful place.  We cannot wait to return."

      "Hopleys is a great camp site. Unfortunately  they had hired all of the bell tents out to a group of people who had a private party. People were arriving in cars all day long. At a guess  i would say 40 of them all together. They constantly  played very very loud music all day and into the night.  Management got them to turn it down on a couple of occasions. But it still carried on. Everybody close to them lost sleep. One of the party actually walked naked across the field in front of us and our young grandchildren at 7 the following morning. FAMILY CAMPING . . . DEFINITELY NOT. IT SHOULD NOT BE ADVERTISED AS SUCH.",
      "I've stayed here many times in all seasons. There is a handy farm shop and cafe on site which is lucky especially as the one time I was backpacking and after a good days walk and no room in my bag I didn't fancy walking much further for provisions. If you exit the site left or right there are two great pubs in walking distance. Turning right the running horse is a traditional large country pub serving food with a large beer garden. Turning left is the hop pole. Great ales and food can be found. Also a nice pit stop if you are walking down towards the town.\nThe campsite itself offers different pitches for tents and electric hook up, hard standing for the vans. Many families book larger pitches so they can join up their tents. The grass slopes gently down and there are a couple of ponds and a stream at the bottom. Recently a new shower and toilet block has been built on the lower part which is clean and tidy for most part. Regular cleans are done daily but in high season with hundreds of people it can be a challenge for them. There is another toilet and shower block at the top of the hill close to the office. A couple of trailer loos can be found dotted about too. So you won't get caught out trying to get to the loo in time for that late night or early morning dash. There are dish washing facilities at both main blocks.\nOn the evenings in the summer entertainment is sometimes put on and you can go and grab a drink and watch the bands. The pizzas are amazing too. There are a couple of play areas for the kids to climb and give you a break for 5.\nThis is a great getaway for couples or families. I have enjoyed it thoroughly with family and friends many times over and that is why I have on this occasion given this review more attention.\nCouldnt recommend it enough. Well done Hopleys. ",

      "We were a group of 30 or so and we had a great time. We all used the pizzaria on Friday night and were really impressed with both the pizzas and the burgers. The tipis were well kitted out although the futons were a wee bit hard. It was great having the fire pits and picnic tables and the shower facilities were nice, clean and there was plenty of hot water.\nWe all used the cafe on Sunday and had delicious breakfasts all round. The ice cream and bread in the farm shop was also tasty and well priced.\nWe'll definitely be back!!!",
      "Great campsite with good facilities.  Allows fires in their firepits.  Has a great cafe that sells stone baked pizza / burgers etc.\ngood kids play area.

Grass was a little boggy but that's down to the autumn weather. Swan was a pain, hissing like he owned the place! Price is a little high but not extortionate. Best visited with CCC rallies as it's a far better price.",

      "I'll start by saying it's not the sort of site we usually stay on but was good for staying on site with a group of chums.  Who so ever was on the pitch before us had not used a breathable ground sheet and we stepped out of the 'van into a mud bath.  Not ideal with the wheelchair.   In addition just one central elsan/grey water point on the size of site isn't really good enough.  The water points are not ideal either as it can feel as if you are rather encroaching on people's pitches.  Staff all seemed helpful and cheery.  Shame we couldn't use the river taxi into Stratford as not accessible.   The Crown up the road was very good for food.  The food on site not so good."

Ideal location to visit friends in Borrowash but the site was dirty, the loo block never cleaned in the 3 days we were there and we went out and bought frish to try and make them a bit more palatable.. The site guy was friendly and did try to help us as the water was all frozen, but thank goodness we could do everything on board otherwise we would have moved on.

      "Fantastic place we have great holidays there every year, (forth year going) BUT the lack of toilets and showers isn't good. You have to go far to reach them if you are a camper. Even some porter Loo's would be better than nothing and electric for campers would be good. We like to have a little luxury when we are away and these issues mean we only go for a few days at a time rather than the week or two we would like too. Great staff, very clean and tidy throughout the campsite, lots of things for the Kids and adults. ",
      "We felt cautious about staying at such a large site during the summer holidays. We have no small children of our own anymore, so tend to use the smaller sites. I take my hat off to the management team. The place was tidy, the bathrooms/toilets were always clean with plenty of hot water. We felt delighted to see so many children out in the fresh air playing football, cricket and on their bikes. Everyone was happy doing their own thing and the facility's were amazing. While the place was busy the sound levels dropped off at night, by midnight you could of heard a pin drop. We would definitely stay again.",
      "This is a BIG campsite. And with a big campsite, there are lots of kids and lots of noise. Don't get me wrong - the staff here are absolutely lovely, and there's a warden who comes round at 11pm to ask people to be quiet. But if you value silence this is not the place for you. The facilities are impeccable - clean and tidy with extra hot showers. The playpark is nice for younger ones and the swimming pool is kept super clean and is nice and warm. This is definitely more of a resort than a campsite - with bingo and entertainment in the pub. It wasn't our usual sort of place and we probably won't be back as we value peace, but if you are more tolerant than me and you enjoy \"family entertainment\" then you'll love it.",
      "Excellent facilities, clean, tidy well managed site. Helpful friendly staff. Great for kids and families. Outdoor pool was fun. Only 4 stars due to having to pay for showers, extortionate shop prices and quite expensive camping fees.",
      "My partner had never ever been camping in her life so we decided to go to callow top as my partner is 67 years old in a few days time i didn't want to take her too far incase she didn't like it and wanted to come home earlier than was expected, but she enjoyed the experance and wishes to go again, that's thanks to the staff as nothing was too much trouble for them.\nThe facilities were very clean and maintained and cleaned daily.\nThere are no hook-up for tents so I can not see the harm in campers being allowed to have silent run generators to have the use of electricity, I believe it would make camping for all concerned to enjoy electricity like everybody else.\nWe intend to go back to Callow Top in the summer when the weather is better than it has been over the last few days."

This Caravan Park is the benchmark all others should be trying to achieve.\nSpacious sites, friendly and helpful staff, great property to go for a drive around and best amenities of any caravan park by far.\nThanks for a most enjoyable stay.",
      "Spent there just one night and it was a wonderful and relaxing experience. Once you leave the highway and turn onto country road you feel like in another world - quiet and peaceful one. Cabins are modern and well furnished and equipped with everything you need. The hosts are wonderful, the lady even waited for us for over two hours until we arrived after 7 pm as she promised on the phone. No light pollution ensures that you can enjoy beautiful night sky as much as you want. It was pretty obvious that camper and caravan owners love this place and I will definitely be back for a longer stay. Definitely recommend to stay overnight rather here than in Broken hill or Cobar if you are looking for a good night sleep and a comfy room. 5 stars from me",
      "We stayed one night on the way to Broken Hill. New managers, Fran and Allen are doing a wonderful job of running the park. They were extremely  welcoming and friendly.The afternoon get together was a great way to meet  other travellers.\nSituated on the waterfront,it is the best place to stay on your way between Broken Hill and Cobar\nThe ammenities are top class and extremely clean.\nLots of grass and beautiful views . Great walk around the billabong  Highly recommend! !!",

      "We stayed here with our Whippet in a tent at a powered site in April 2017 for 2 weeks. The owners are very friendly and helpful people, and they gave us a warm welcome.\n\nI was very impressed by the cleanliness of the toilets and showers. Every time I used them they were spotless. There is a large and well equipped camp kitchen, and that too was very clean.\n\nThe park is set in a very beautiful location, with lots of big shady trees all around the park, and lawn around each site. The area is home to the regent parrot, and we saw several of them in the park, especially when the owners used the sprinklers to water the lawns. The River Murray is a very short walk through to the back of the park. I could never grow tired of looking at the beautiful scenery along the river. A couple of times in the early evening we saw kangaroos in the distance along the river bank.\n\nWe had a very peaceful and pleasant stay, and I would have no hesitation in recommending the Kingston-on-Murray Caravan Park as the perfect place to stay for families, couples and anyone who enjoys the great outdoors.\n\nP. S. I wholeheartedly endorse the review by Rhi Swat.",
      "This is such a great friendly family owned and operated caravan park. \nSet in amongst the lovely big trees that home some amazing birds with nests fall of babies. Nice and quite, small but enough room. It has a great camp kitchen that has everything you need with a full size fridge, freezer and table tennis table also the toilet/shower block is very large and very clean too. It has a swimming pool, a nice big playground for the little ones, you can hire karts to ride around. It has a massive grassed area for footy and cricket. Its a short walk down to the river where you can throw in a line or two, sit back, relax and take in the lovely scenery or you could hire a canoe to paddle along the river. We stayed 3 nights 4 days but could have stayed a lot longer. Thanks for the lovely customer service from all that work at the park. We will definitely be returning. ",

They look to be in the same condition (I remember the curtains and not so great gas heaters) given the prices asked I would have though a little work would have gone into updating them. The tennis court, pool and pontoons on the river are new additions. The area is excellent for fishing and water skiing. I am sure a little money updating would go a long way",
      "Wonderful",
      "Stunning property with sensational river access. Swimming pool, tennis court playground for the kids!! Shacks are basic but the views are AMAZING - need to take some firewood or get some from the caretaker - bonfire & marshmallows a must. Might try the new house next time.    "

      "We had a lovely weekend at the Old School House. Amenities are very basic, there is a kitchen area with a sink and cold (icey in winter) rain water (Not for drinking) plus a toilet on site as well as basics in the house itself (2x bunks plus a few spare matresses, table and combustion heater)\nPlenty of wood around to be gathered for the fire but we were glad to bring some additional redgum for the inside fire at night (brrrrr) as the old pine is very quick burning!\nLovely sheltered location, very very private. Lots to explore from the nearby ruins to the pine forests and Heysen trail. LOADS of kangaroos and red spotty toadstools kept the kids fascinated.\nPlenty of space for additional tents too.\nThere is a massive open stretch of grass next to the site too(fire access I am guessing) , perfect throwing the ball around etc.\n\nbring a small gas cooker if you can, plenty of room in the kitchen lean too to set it up. Plus bring plenty of drinking water.\n\nAccess is off Springton Road (Gate 4) not Wirra Wirra as the google maps tried to tell me. Forestry SA will provide you with access code for the gate and the building when you contact the day before arrival.\n\nGreat spot, we will be back with the kids again soon."

I've never been at a campground that had the volume of mosquitos and black flies as this place had.  Being on a motorcycle, I set the record for getting the tent set up in order to have a place to hide.  A dull roar existed through night from the beat of insect rings.  Upon waking the next morning the tent screen was completely covered in bugs.  I was very happy with the campground caretaker who checked to see if i needed anything.",

The view is stunning - glacier view indeed!! - and the location is perfect for exploring the Smithers area. The owners are excellent hosts, the property is immaculate, and the RV sites are a reasonable size even for my 51-foot long combination.",
      "Away from the city . Peaceful . Cabins are awesome and very reasonably priced. Fancy hotel rooms suck compared to here. Stay there next time you want to get away from it all. You won't regret it.",
      "Stayed 2 nights at 27 a night. Antenna TV picked up 3 channels, Verizon cell coverage good, nice (but small) showers. Parking a little close but very pretty. Would have given 5 stars if they participated in some discount programs (Good Sam, Passport America... or had Free Wifi). WiFi cost extra.",
      "I decided to take an impromptu trip to Smithers with my son and our dog and decided to stay here. Great place! Cabin had everything we needed and more. Was so nice to get away yet be so close to town. Kitchen had everything we needed and the view is breath taking. Would definitely stay again",
      "A small quaint RV park nestled just outside of Smithers. Enjoyed a one night stay at a cabin which was nicely decorated and very roomy. All the necessities where included which was a nice touch. My only contention was that the abundance of rules and strictly inforced 11am check out time. Nothing like having the caretaker place linens and cleaning supplies outside your door while looking inside at 1020am. Other than that one little hiccup; was an enjoyable stay. I would recommend you stay for sure!"

      "O camping é muito bom!  Simples, mas bem limpio, ordenado e confortável. Tem cozinha e quartos para compartilhar também se quiser. O preço também muito bom! A ubicação muito boa! \nA atenção do encaregado foi ótima.  \nO único problema que tivemos foi com o barulho.. Uma galera chegou 2 noites seguidas fazendo muito barulho de madrugada e ficaram falamdo gritando muito tempo.  O camping todo acordou a causa de eles.  \nEu falei com eles (falando \"cala boca\") porque estivemos 2 noites sem dormir por eles.  Eles acharam que eu faltei o respeito, mas foram eles que faltaram o respeito do camping todo. \nA primeira noite o encaregado pideu para eles fazer menos barulho e continuaram igual,  a segunda noite pedi eu e depois o encaregado convidou eles retirar do camping.  Achei que o encaregado esteve muito bom!  \nUm dos caras que fez esse barulho foi Kaio Graco Cardamone e a moza que \"faltou o respeito para eles\" foi eu.\nO que foi bem ruim foi o ultimo dia que estivemos lá que o dono autorizou para que pessoas que não estavam no camping fizeram uma festa lá. Colocaram a música bem forte desde o meio dia até 2.30 da manhã. Foi muito ruim!!!",
      "O camping é bem legal, so falta um pouco de ordem com o barulho, as pessoas nao respeitan as horas do silêncio e depois culpam ao encargado isso é de idiota .  Banheiros limpos e o atendimento de Fabião é o melhor do camping, cozinha completa e limpa, ótima localização. Só tem que controlar um pouco o barulho. A gente não descanso bem nos 5 dias a causa do barulho.",
      "Lugar péssimo, chegamos tarde e fizemos um pouco de barulho, ao invés de vir conversar uma pessoa começou a gritar descontroladamente para a gente calar a boca sem o mínimo de educação. O dono do camping falou que se não estivesse tudo bem a gente poderia se retirar. Nunca passei uma situação semelhante em nenhum camping, bem ruim."

      "Fui em 2014 o dono estava de moleta e tinha um rapaz de Santo Andre super chato que dizia que estava ajudando o Dono do Camping........affffff.....foi horrivel......povo chato...chato....chato\n8",
      "Acampei pela primeira vez e gostei muito da estrutura do camping menina flor. Eu e meu esposo fomos bem recebidos pelo Alemão, tivemos boa assistência dele nos 5 dias que estivemos no camping. As fotos do site são fiéis ao ambiente (espaço externo, banheiros com 3 sanitários e 3 duchas e cozinha comunitária). Minha única sugestão para quem pretende utilizar a cozinha, e levar seus próprios utensílios. O amanhecer é lindo, acordar com o som dos passarinhos foi o melhor despertador. O camping estava cheio devido o feriado de 12/10, mas a maioria dos campistas eram famílias, mesmo assim o uso do banheiro foi tranquilo e não houve nenhuma intercorrência, foram dias muito tranquilos. O Meninas por é pertinho da praia do meio, praia do rancho e atrás tem acesso para trilha da cachoeira pedra que engole. 🤗",
      "Me hospedei durante o feriado de 7 de setembro ao chegar vimos que as instalações eram realmente como mostram no site e tudo bem limpo e organizado.  Mas infelizmente todo dia quando ia tomar banho  caia a energia e tinhamos que tomar banho gelado! \nFora isso durante duas noites ficaram fazendo muito barulho até tarde ( e de acordo com as regras é proibido barulho depois das 22) mas nao foi o que aconteceu! E para finalizar no ultimo dia teve briga dentro do camping, uma gritaria, pessoas caindo em cima de barracas, gente sangrando, criança chorando assutada, infelizmente fiquei decepcionada.",
      "Viajei no feriado de 7 de setembro. O camping tem ótima localização e estrutura. Banheiro com vestiário e cozinha compartilhada que todo mundo sempre deixou tudo organizado. \nA energia caia pq a cidade estava super lotada. Isso é um problema de estrutura do lugar.\nTeve briga entre amigos. Acontece! Não tinha como expulsar a família com criança após às 22h né?!\nNão sei que barulho que as pessoas tanto estão falando. Teve show 2 vezes na esquina (centro), que por sinal estava bem legal.",
      "Apesar do camping ter um regulamento houve duas brigas no camping e ninguém foi expulso do lugar....Ambiente familiar uma ova....Além de tudo o Camping têm  um bar com música ao vivo muito próximo que faz uma bagunça.....Não recomendo e não volto nesse campimg"

Não me hospedaria de novo, mesmo com o preço em conta.",

Mas no geral, como fiquei com minha esposa a maior parte do tempo curtindo a cidade, é algo suportável.",

      "Pior camping que já fui na vida! O camping possui apenas 2 banheiros, para um camping q estava lotado. Além disso os banheiros estavam imundos, não possui papel higiênico você precisa levar o seu e não consegui tomar banho nenhum dia lá. Tive que pagar para tomar banho no camping ao lado. Só não fui embora pois já havia pago as diárias e não devolvem o dinheiro. O que achei mais absurdo foi o fato de no último comentar com uma funcionária sobre a limpeza dos banheiros e a mesma disse que era funcionária da cozinha e que sabia da falta do mínimo de limpeza, mas que não podia fazer nada que falasse com o dono, pedi que ela somente passasse para frente o feedback de um cliente. Pois bem, agora a maior surpresa de todas, o dono fez um barraco enorme e nos expulsou do camping, e disse que nós é que éramos sujos! Isso mesmo, fomos expulsos! Depois disso uma outra responsável disse que podíamos ficar, porém fomos embora, após essa falta de respeito imensa. Nunca mais volto lá! Só estou registrando isso aqui, pra que isso não aconteça com outras pessoas também.",

      "Passei o feriado de Tiradentes (2017) neste camping e a experiência foi bem ruim!\nO camping é pequeno, então as barracas ficam muito coladas umas nas outras. O camping possui um pequeno bar, mas não oferece serviço algum ali. O acesso ao camping é meio bagunçado, e apesar de ganhar uma pulseira de acesso, na prática entra quem quer. Como a área é pequena e enche muito, a disputa por tomadas é intensa. A área de convivência e cozinha são muito acanhadas e acaba ficando tumultuado. Até aí, o camping seria considerável razoável, mas os banheiros.... Simplesmente lastimável!!!\nO banheiro masculino possui 5 privadas, mas 1 estava quebrada e 4 chuveiros, 2 elétricos e 2 de água fria. Acredite se quiser, mas apenas 1 chuveiro funcionava razoavelmente. Nos demais simplesmente não tinha água!! Papel higiênico era coisa rara. E a água que sai do chuveiro, torneiras, etc e de péssima qualidade. Água amarela, provavelmente de algum poço sem tratamento descente. E a limpeza dos banheiros era praticamente inexistente. Terrível!\nA única vantagem do camping é que ele é 100% arborizado/sombreado. Por um lado é bom que o torna mais fresco, por outro é ruim que em caso de chuva, como foi o meu caso ao longo do feriado, nada seca!\nSimplesmente não vale a pena!",
      "Me hospedei no carnaval e a experiência não foi das melhores. Sorte que eu passava o dia inteiro fora. Banheiro feminino sujo, nenhum responsável no camping, música alta no vizinho até 5h da manhã. ",
      "Este foi o pior camping que eu já fui! No site diz que os banheiros são o diferencial e que há segurança 24h, isso não é verdade! O banheiro esteve um nojo por quase todo o tempo em que estive lá e por um descuido deixei minha carteira na cadeira e mesa onde ficou o segurança do camping a noite toda e ainda sim retiraram todo o dinheiro dela e os meus cartões de crédito. Mesmo eu indo fazer o BO e cancelando os cartões, a medida que o camping encontrou de me ressarcir foi: nenhuma. Achei justo receber o meu valor das diárias, mas eles disseram que simplesmente não fariam isso. Eu estava acompanhada de amigos que me ajudaram mas fico pensando se eu estivesse sozinha, provavelmente eu teria passado fome dentre outras coisas. O pior de tudo é que os donos do camping não ficam no Brasil, o gerente não vai ao camping e a atendente que fica lá não pode tomar nenhuma medida justa para a resolução dos problemas ficando dependente de ligar para o devido responsável diante qualquer situação atipica, ou seja: ninguém quer se responsabilizar por nada, apenas ganhar dinheiro! Nem um café ou palavra de conforto foi dada. Se eu pudesse lhes dar um conselho seria: não vá a este camping, você pode se arrepender imensamente! Tem muitos outros pela ilha, muitos mesmo. Vale a pena pesquisar melhor!",
      "Cozinha muito mal equipada e não vi segurança 24h além das câmeras de segurança e nem distribuíram identificações dos hóspedes para ter o acesso livre no camping depois das 17:00 conforme o site. Com isso qualquer um entrava na área do camping. Ausência dos funcionários é outra questão que deveriam trabalhar para solucionar os problemas. Apesar disso, banheiros limpos e área muito tranquila e arborizada.",
      "MUITO mal vigiado, entra quem quer a qualquer horário, inúmeras vezes sem nenhum responsável no camping, sem contar o estado das geladeiras e dos banheiros, imundos, a água acabou e depois voltou marrom, não era possível nem ao menos escovar os dentes. \n\nLAMENTÁVEL!!"

      "A mi családunknak életreszóló élmény volt a 4 napos Túr kenutúra. A személyzet maximálisan segítőkész, kedves, türelmes volt végig, minden kérdésünkre, problémánkra udvariasan reagáltak. Az étel nagyon finom volt!!!  A kemping jó hangulatú,    esetleg jó lett volna egy új háló a röpipályára. A szobák amolyan kempinges szobák: kicsi, zsúfolt, dehát csak aludni kell..Az evezés útvonala csodálatos, igazi természettel való együttélés, a szabályozatlan rész kemény volt, de nagyon örülünk, hogy teljesítettük, nem mindennapi élmény volt!! Az evezés nagyon összehozza a társaságot, klassz barátságok szövődnek!☺ Biztos, hogy megyünk még!!",
      "Minden rendben van.",
      "\nKissé káoszos.",
      "2016.08.9-én voltunk egy napig a campingben, kölcsönöztünk egy kenut és egy kétszemélyes kajakot. Nem tudom mások hogyan oldják meg az 55 kg-os kenu lecipelését a vízig ami elég messze van ahhoz, hogy elvegye az ember kedvét az egész túrázástól, gátra fel le, de egy család (apa, anya három gyerek) nagyon nehezen tudja levonszolni a partig. A meglepetés csak a vízen ért, amikor kb 15 perc múlva a kajak hátsó légzsákja úgy megtelt vízzel (lyukas volt), hogy át kellett a két gyereknek szállni a kenuba és utánfutóként cipelve magunkkal húztuk végig egész nap. Érkezéskor közöltem a problémát az illetékes személlyel, de nem hogy visszaadták volna a nem használt hibás kajak árát, de még egy elnézést sem sikerült kapnunk az incidensért. A kajak lapátokról már nem is beszélve, mert olyan szinten voltak szétkorhadva a rétegelt falemezből készült tollak, hogy szétnyíltak mint egy rózsa. Nem biztos, hogy máskor is idejövünk, habár a víz az gyönyörű.",

      "Були у серпні 2017. Сама будова непогана, гарне розташування, до центра міста, приблизно сім км (10 хвилин на авто). З того що не сподобалося: за три доби у номері небуло прибирання. Коли попросив пакет для сміття, прийшла прибиральниця винесла сміття але так і не прибрала. Басейн виявився з поліетилену, каркасный. Платно,  проте на сайті це не зазначено. На другий день він зацвів, так що залишилися без водних процедур,  а було дуже спекотно. В готелі раз вечеряли, очікували замовлення сорок хвилин. Тому вечерять їздили у місто.",
      "Місце - спокійне, тихе. Кухня - дещо не сподобалось. Готель - чисто, охайно, просторо, погано - не робочий телевізор ( всі канали \"шиплять\"), незрозуміла подача води. А взагалі, я ще туди повернусь.",
      "Из плюсов: ухоженная территория, внешне все выглядит симпатично. Очень приветливая и милая девушка администратор, вкусная кухня и книги в номере. \nНачиналось все хорошо)). \nИз минусов: грязно. Скорее всего, что номер перед нами не убирали вовсе (пыль по углам, на унитазе коричневые брызги известно чего, стены душевой в грязных потеках). Попытались включить телевизор-не удалось. Удлинитель поломан, а когда вынимаешь вилку из розетки, вилка остаётся в руках, а провода в розетке! В номере были кровать и диван. У дивана оказались  отломаны подлокотники. Сантехника в ужасном состоянии (кран от душа остался в руке при первом же открытии воды). Ну и вишенкой на торте было отсутствие горячей воды утром. ",

      "The location of the resort is amazing, with beautiful scenery. But if you go with the expectation of four stars hotels in Europe you will be disappointed. The rooms have old furniture and the bed is not very comfortable. The bathrooms should definitely be better maintained and cleaner. \nWe had only bed and breakfast so we had lunch and dinner in the \"a la carte\" restaurant. The food is bland and tasteless and the service is really slow and gets your orders wrong 80% of the time. Food is way better in the town, however, if you want to relax and not go to the town every day, you are basically stuck with whatever you can get in the restaurant. They could use a small shop with basic products you can buy and have drinks and dinner in your room or on the porch/balcony. \n\nAll in all, it's a perfect spot for relaxing, but I would not choose it the second time.",
      "A very nice hotel right at the beach. We had a large bungalow with ocean view and can't complain.  The animation staff wasn't too annoying but they only spoke to the Italian guests - that includes information about events and excursions.  We spend most days at beach clubs such as 'the social club'  in the city because it was superior in aspects of comfy sun beds,  access to the ocean (always green flag) choice &  prices of the beverages. Anyways,  the hotel is great! \nWe were told some stories about the safety outside the hotel - I guess to keep people (and their money) inside.  We were outside every day - including remote areas.  All people we meet were very friendly and helpful. ",

      "Avoid!!!  Absolute horrible Camping!   \nVery unfriendly stuff and the facilities are terrible and fall to pieces! ( posted photos) No lights in the toilets or showers, no showerheads or lockers on the doors, nothing gets cleaned, everything is broken!  the unfriendly  guy from the reception came up at 11.30 pm and wake us up as he would like to see my passport again and made a story the next day for hes reason...  im am NOT a fossy person at all and i have been to many campings in my life ,  this is by far the worst, and with 110 dh.  For 2 persons and a car, a very expesive  one to !!  Dont go there!!   absolutely horrible place!!!",
      "We (hubby and I, both 27 years old) stayed at Camping International in Fes in December 2011.  It was the most horrible experience we have had in all of Morocco.  \n\nFor starters it is very poorly signed - we were at the front gate and still didn't know it was the right place.   Inside the man at the office was very friendly.... too friendly!   The hard-sell started immediately - he INSISTED we book a Medina tour through him, spouting that the medina is dangerous and full of feral children that will steal from your pockets.  He said he books official guides through the tourist office.  We are well travelled and not at all afraid of the Medina, but decided to book a 'half-day tour' (his words) so we could learn more about its history. \n\nHis quote: 150 dirhams for 1/2 day tour, 250 dirhams for full day.... I will continue my story later. \n\nHe also pushed his restaurant on us quite forcibly (we didnt eat there).\n\nMorocco is very quite in winter.  Only a few other campers.  Site was pretty clean but the toilets were very dirty, locks were broken and the sinks were falling off the walls. The hot water didn't work at all in the female block.  It was sporadic in the mens but we did get showers.\n\nThe following morning we met our guide who made us drive him to the medina (we were told there would be a bus).  We only have a two seater so I had to lay in the back of the van all day.  Long story short - we were taken to many stores just to be pressure-sold crap.  At the end the guide said there was no such thing as a 'half-day tour' (despite it only going for 3 hours) and demanded 250 dirhams, plus a tip.  This was probably our fault though.... always clarify the price 10 times before starting! \n\nFrom what we have since learned I think we were sold a tout guide (he had no official credentials and didn't were a badge even though we were told by Camping International that he would).  I assume Camping International Fes pocketed some kind of commission.  By comparison, tout guides hired directly from the Medina rarely cost more than 150 dirhams.  We felt very ripped off. \n\nWe returned to the campsite at 12.30pm to pay for the previous night and collect my husbands passport (they keep this as collateral but nowhere else in Morocco have they done this).  2 men at the reception demanded payment for 2 nights because we 'hadn't told them we were leaving' (we definitely had - it was even written in their book).  Because it was past the 12 noon checkout time we HAD to pay an additional night of 120 dirhams.  It wasn't like we were taking up space or causing others to be turned away from the near-empty site - our van had been at the medina since 9am!\n\nThese 2 men verbally abused both of us, screaming at the top of their lungs how 'dumb' and 'stupid' we were, and would not return my husbands passport.  However we don't put up with being bullied and stood our ground.  It got close to physical violence; 2 on 1 against my husband.  It was horrific. \n\nAfter 5 minutes of yelling and our threats to call the police we paid our money and got the passport.  I was disgusted by the whole experience. \n\nCamping International de Fès is out to part its customers with their money, nothing else.  AVOID AVOID AVOID!!   \n\nIf we went to Fes again it would be well worth staying at the campsite between Meknes and Moulay Idriss (about a 40 minute drive away).  A little oasis, the owner brings you mint tea in the morning and is a wealth of information.  And all for 1/2 the price of Camping International.",
      "Fuimos con nuestra camper y estuvimos allí de cine... Muy bien los baños, WiFi, piscina excelente, toma de electricidad y un maravilloso personal que nos hizo la estancia magnífica... Un poco apartado de la ciudad haciendo fantástico el descanso...\nMuchísimas gracias por todo, hasta la próxima amigos...",
      "Pulito ma un poco disyante dalla città...grande piscina gratis!!!",
      "Mal entretenu, Loin des centres d'interets, pas de possibilité de restauration autre que le restau du camping, Inadapté pour le camping traditionnel."

      "We had a very pleasant stay. The camping is basic but beautiful, with so many cherry trees and lots of shadows. The owner is very kind and he left us two bowls full of cherrys in our place while we where out, so nice!",
      "I'm surprised by the rest of the reviews I see here. I had such a good experience I thought I should post so that there is a bit of balance. I stayed in one of the rooms in the bunkhouse. It was very cheap for how nice it was and there were no problems at all. Showed worked fine.\n\nThe owner was also very friendly and pleasant.\n\nThere was a family of cats with kittens at the back OK the house that were adorable!\n\nIt's a shame others had such a bad time, maybe the owner has ups and downs.",
      "April 2016\nEiner der schönsten Plätze von 30 besuchten in Marokko. Einfache Sanitäreinrichtungen, aber: Camping unter blühenden Kirschbäumen, total netter Platzbesitzer (Hassan spricht deutsch), tolle Tajine, grandioser Fußweg in den Zedernwald mit Berberaffen am Cèdre Gouraud. Sehr schöner Fußweg nach Azrou, ca. 1 Std.\n\nTop location!!!\nOne of the most romantic places in Morocco during the bloom of the many cherry trees. The chattering of the storks and the singing of the birds make this place a little paradise. You can easily hike to the ceder forest with the many Barbary macaques. The hike to Azrou through the gardens with their friendly inhabitants can also be recommended.\nHassan is very helpful and served one of the best Tajines we had in Morocco. I can't understand the negative comments on this place. Free WiFi is also available at the main house. Just look at my photos and decide yourselves wether the bad reports are justified or not. I would always return to this special place!",
      "Please avoid this place. For the truth I am not demanding, but the owner does not care about anything. There were still problems with water, showers, wild dogs and the owner who likes to drink. I do not recommend.",
      "The owner called Hassan, very friendly guy, but unfortunatelly to possesive for money. Maybe because he is drinking wine every evening (and as you know it is not allowed in Marocco, so he needs a lot of money to get his bottles..)\nI met there a couple which was staying at the camping for a longer time. They where very friendly with the owner, but when they finally planned to move on, he was using a chantage to get twice more money! Took all of they things while they where away and said he would not give back unless they pay more.\n\nReally bad story.. and so dissapointing , since "

We ended up using our own on board the trailer . The  campsites were not particularly level nor well drained. They should be on levelled gravel for an rv. The city water service for my site was actually on the adjacent site and had to be shared. A difficult trick with only one tap. In the end I  filled my tank, which required my full 100 ft of hosepipe that I, fortunately, was carrying. Among our one-night stays across country from BC to Ontario, this campsite was the least satisfactory in my experience.",

There are sites backing onto the river but you can't see it because of the tall weeds. Washrooms were old and needed major upgrading. We only stayed one night - that was long enough.",
      "Stay here just one night on our way through on our across Canada RV trip.\nNice trees in campground & good park for kids. Bathrooms could use upgrade. But probably the nicest option out of the RV parks in the area. There is a spot close by to rent kayaks & canoes to tour down the river that runs by campground which would be nice to do if you are in area for longer stays. ",
      "Location is not the best. I mean surrounding area. Tent sites are not very private. More like sharing one big lawn with others. But it is not big deal. Their washrooms were clean and free unlimited showers. We spent a night there on our way to Winnipeg and it was good enough. Thanks. ",
      "We arrived travel-weary around 8:45 pm and the office was closed, so we drove around and found the last tent site and claimed it. The sites are small with a few trees. The fire pits were filled with garbage and there was litter on the ground. The bathroom smells moldy, needs an upgrade and serious cleaning. When we left at 8:40 am the office was still closed. The campground's location is very odd, next to train tracks and a huge oil depot. It is in a semi-secluded valley though so you don't see these things once you're in. Not the kind of place I'd stay for an extended visit but good enough for a one night stop.",

There is beauty and happiness here so dont think thier isnt its all in way you think. So come and see and you will know if you like the woods this is place to see. It can be a beautiful fortress.  But they have to make it that way. They need to build it up. Make it strong and make it safe.  This place needs protection. This place needs love that we couldnt give it.

Saturday night a party of 30-50 people went on until after 2:30am (last time I looked at my watch) and Sunday night the camp hosted a DJ that started at 7pm and played until 2am.  After that the chaos continued into the campground until after 4am.  Had we been told upfront there was no \"quiet hours\" we wouldn't have stayed.",
      "Awesome campground! Water and electric sites, small beach for the kids cool little general store for all your needs and it's perfect if you love to fish the tippecanoe river is right behind your campsites! I can fish from my picnic table 😂😂",
      "We went in the beginning of July with no reservations and had no problem finding a good site. We were able to camp literally RIGHT ON the river and next to the beach. The campground owner was very nice to us. The sites were decent sized and each had their own water, electric, picnic table and fire pit. However, the fire pits didn't have any grill/grates on them, which made it difficult to cook food over the fire. The beach and swimming area weren't too deep, muddy, or seaweedy. The bathrooms were really the only part of the campground that I disliked. I think there was only 1 bathroom building and in the women's restroom, there were only 2 stalls and one (pretty nasty looking) shower stall. The only sink available was outside of the restrooms, had trash and debris in it, and didn't have any soap or paper towels. ",

      "I've been coming here for 13+ years. I am well aware of the amounts of kids/ people running around; hence the 5mph speed limit. The owners are sweet, but the majority of the elder-aged people who hang out & smoke in golf carts in front of the office all day are horrible. They'll yell, \"Slow down!\" almost every time I pull into the campground. Unless they have access to my speedometer and are willing to buy me a new clutch to go EVEN slower than 5, they need to stop playing police and be respectful.",
      "This campground is so clean and quiet. Staff is very friendly and helpful! Lots of things to do. Will definitely be camping there again!!",
      "We stayed here July 2017 for 4 nights. The price was half the cost of Indiana beach Campground. First of all, the workers are extremely nice to the campers. No complaints whatsoever about them. Just super curteous people. The campground itself isn't what I would call \"dirty\" it just has a very scruffy look. Weeds everywhere not manicured at all. Trees either fell or were cut down all over the Campground. It looked like they just left the wood where it landed. It stormed one night and all in front of our camper was water we had to walk in. The hookups such as electric, water and sewer looked as if a person just randomly placed them wherever. Water hook up might be 20 ft away on front side and electric 25 ft on backside of camper. A real pain! The water is disgusting, it's brown in color and smells like rusty metal. The whole camper smelled from it. If you are looking for peaceful evenings, forget that. This is the noisiest place I've ever stayed. I love animals and have 2 dogs of my own. They are leashed at all times. Seasonal campers just let the dogs run. Including the workers who has a Rottweiler that rides on her golf cart. Not leashed and jumps off. I saw it happen. My dogs are leashed and I expect others to be leashed also. For everyones protection. Like I said the workers are so friendly I really hate to leave a bad review, but it was probably one of the worst places I've stayed. If I ever came back to this area again, would I stay there again? Probably not, I think the higher priced Campground would definitely be worth my money.",
      "One of the worst campgrounds I have ever been to! The noise is beyond ridiculous at all hours of the night, fights, screaming...you name it...they have it here! It's a shame to as the owners seem very nice. The place needs a lot of work. It starts with the clients and then the roads and bathrooms. If you come to Monticello stay at IB or Indiana Beach",

      "Great camping experience,  we had a primitive site by the Wabash River,  quiet, peaceful, senic. The staff was very helpful and pleasant.  It looks like they have a theme 1 night of the weekend,  we had a chili dinner night the food was really good and it was all you could eat.  My family is going to plan at least 2 camping trips every year at this place yearly.  The other campers we're courteous to surrounding campers and offered any help if needed.  They offer showers, laundry and firewood at a very reasonable price they even deliver the wood.  Fantastic place for the kids and family.",
      "Very friendly staff, roomy sites. Not totally level sites, but not bad either. I've seen much worse.  All in all, I liked it and I'd come back.  Very pleased.",
      "This campground is fantastic.  The owners are friendly and they have lots of activities on weekends.  Lots of trees everywhere for plenty of shade. Love it!",
      "I have been reading the reviews, and I had to speak up. My husband and I stayed here with our children and had a very great experience! We would have brought our dog but he passed away shortly before coming. The management was extremely nice and informative about fun things to do in the area, and the fun things planned there throughout the year. This is a campground with so many things to do! We weren't able to go riverside due to flooding but that was because of safety not anything in the owner's control. We absolutely loved the scenery here, we camped in a primitive site in a tent and were treated with respect, and are really hoping to go back in a couple weekends, watching the weather though as it may rain us out unfortunately. Thank you for everything hope to see you again soon.",
      "A nice quiet place but not enough spots for big rigs with towing trailer. They had 4 pull through spot. 3 looked like they were bring occupied permanently. We stayed in number 4 which was just long enough. Also it was right by the swimming pool. Spots weren't real wide. Our slide went out against the electric. One of the owners does smoke so be prepared when you go in the office. There is a convenience store in walking distance and the river is within walking distance. That is why it got a 3 instead of a 2. Will not stay here again."

The campsites are so close together. The pictures online were very deceiving. We had come from several hours away and didn't have another reservation and felt we had no choice but to stay one night. While he was booking us (much to my dismay) I was able to call the nearby Salamonie State Park and find a campsite. I asked him to go back and cancel the transaction he had just made and they owner refused. They charged us and would not give our money back. I WOULD NEVER STAY AT THIS CAMPGROUND.

      "My family and I are very upset!! My mother made a reservation for Saturday October 14th (got a confirmation email). Went to the destination and descovered that our reservation for Saturday has been rented out to someone else because the family wanted Saturday not Friday. Old Mill did NOT try calling nor emailing my mother to try to let us know that it has been taken. The lady up front did NOT feel bad or compensate for anything! That is wrong! We drove an hour away just to drive back home! I would not recommend this place to anyone because their customer service is awful! They deserve NO stars!!",
      "A very large place which appeared the majority (and nicest) spots were permanent.\nCalled in advance & was told they did not have handicapped spot available.  Lady said 425 would accommodate our needs.  When we arrived the spot was grossly downhill.  No other spots were available so we left.",
      "Great place to go and relax with the Grand Kids  and play mini golf and swim. Quiet nights ,peaceful days. Mostly seasonal campers have the shade trees but still a nice place. Staff is friendly and helpful",

      "I would love to tell you about the excellent time my group and I (non-lot renters, non-seasonals) had camping out here the one season we did, frequently. We did have a great time. I would love to tell you about the fun events this campground holds that we participated in, because they do, and we did. But what stands out to me is that when a situation takes place that absolutely cannot be stood for, like sexual harassment, suddenly you're not a valued member of the community for speaking out against it and refusing to tolerate it. You're an instigator. You're a liar. You've made waves. No resolution will be sought. Your side of the story will not be heard by anyone who can make decisions or escalate matters. You will not feel welcomed any longer, and you will have to accept the fact that it is now swept under the rug, and if you don't come back, you don't come back. Also there are fish in the pond, but they hate me. Spent hours and hours trying to catch one with no success, so there's that too. ",

      "Harassment is the only way to describe our experience with the many park staff. We attempted to camp here with 2 couples for a week. We arrived first and set up our tent on the gravel tent spot and parked our car in a spot the looked like it was meant for a car as it was gravel as well. Our friends arrived a short time later and did the same. The first parks Canada staff came by \"Hello, bonjour\" and ripped us a new one for the placement of the car as well as the amount of \"units\" on the site. Again we paid for 4 ppl and had 2 tents, yet the cars that fit with tones of room left were too many units. Our friends had checked in at the front when they arrived and we're told this was fine. We moved the car and we're given a \"pass\" by the parks guy on the number of tents. Next day same thing. \"Hello, bonjour\" from a different parks employee saying we had to many units. We explained the situation and again the parks Canada worker \"gave us a pass\" to have 2 tents for  2 couples. Then \"Hello, bonjour\" you have bear attractants on your table as we had just finished lunch and had yet to put away the sealed coke cans or my toothbrush. Next day \"hello, bonjour\" again with the number of units on the site. Again a \"oh then don't worry about it\" once we had spoken to them about the situation. We came to fear the parks Canada trucks doing there ever so frequent checks. Now again this morning at 0830 while asleep in our tent that has been in the same spot for 5 nights and had 5 different parks Canada employees inspect it we are woken up by yet another \"hello, bonjour.\" Now this guy says our tent in on green space. I promise you it is on gravel. The harrassment has been non stop from the staff here. There are no showers in the bathrooms. The water runs from the taps a milky snow white color. Wabasso is not a place to come camping with friends. Perhaps with a family that can share a camper or tent but their expectations for other groups is unrealistic. The staff is rude and does not communicate with eachother which truly has put a dark cloud over this whole trip for us. Won't be returning."

Get up for the sunrise and walk over to the east side to see it if you don't get a site nearby. Good prices for water and power and they even give you free firewood!!",

(Unfortunately, they were fully booked, so we stayed at another campground and just came here during the days)",

I looked at the cancellation policy and saw that we would be paying a $25 cancellation fee but would get the rest back as we gave over a week's notice to cancel. I contacted the resort and received $6.50 back for one night minus the cancellation fee. I am still waiting for the full refund for the second night and the resort will not return any of my communications. I was excited about the place and was going to try again next year when we could reschedule our trip, but this will not be happening now. I had read the fine print and know about the cancellation fee, but the lack of communication about the refund for the second night is unacceptable. It's been over three weeks now. It's only $35, you'd think they'd just process the refund as we gave sufficient notice...",

We don't use the washrooms and didn't have to do laundry. I wish the wifi was better in this day and age there should be no problem with wifi but as we are only staying 1 night we found this campground to be really nice",
      "Nice spot along the lake. Campsites had very little privacy. Lots of junk laying around which gave it a poor vibe. Aside from the new playground the park felt run down and rough. It's unfortunate as the area has potential. 50 plus for a night this was our most expensive stay and the worst park we have visited on our journey. Nice staff park needs to be upkept.",
      "Small campsite with limited (but clean!) facilities. Next to Williamson Lake, which is also open to people who are not staying on the campsite.\n\nWiFi range is limited to around 30 feet around the office, so you're out of luck if you get a spot towards the end of the site.\n\nDo bring your mosquito repellent, quiet waters will attract a lot of these pests during the warm season!"

      "This weekend (July Long) was our first time staying here, it was a last minute decision, and we were lucky they even had a spot available...  I thought it was a cute little campsite! I love that it sits along the river and can’t wait to camp there again and spend the day floating down. It is really close to the highway, so of course it’s a bit loud but I didn’t find it unbearable. The only 2 things that I didn’t like was the bathrooms, they stunk so bad… I guess that comes along with outhouses, but damn it was bad. And the mosquitoes were horrible! Couldn’t sit still for a minute without swatting away mosquitoes… but that could have just been this time. \nI’ll definitely visit again. If it’s on your way and you need somewhere to stay, I think it’s just fine!",
      "Many sites on the Bow river & on a creek. First come first serve camping available. Had some friendly wildlife encounters. Mosquito population was high. Very scenic, there is vehicle noise from nearby highway. ",
      "Convenient location close to Banff and Calgary. Close convenience store. Awesome scenic location next to the river and relatively spacious camping spaces. Only down sides were thick mosquitoes and smelly toilets but worth it for the camping. ",
      "I went tenting here in a group of four with two tents and had to pay $26 a night PER TENT. It was a rip off considering there was no services besides a shared out house and water pump. If you are going in a group I suggest all sleeping in one big ten or trailer because you will save $26 a night. Also the person working at the campsite was not friendly at all.",
      "Pretty basic provincial campground with only camping spots and toilets. No showers and or garbage bins (that I could find). It's near the highway, but the traffic is far enough away that it's not loud, unlike the camping sites in Canmore where the traffic is very close. Very few bugs when I was there last weekend. "

Showers cost $3 for {not-really-long-enough-to-shower} minutes! Bear boxes. No wifi. Staff quite friendly and near shops and the visitor centre.",
      "Very nice place. Clean and comfortable.  Owners are super nice and very helpful. Has clean bathrooms /showers. Also has a laundromat.  Would definitely recommend this to all and would come back again.",
      "Horrible Horrible Horrible. The Semi trucks, crotch rockets and regular Trans Canada Highway traffic are coming thru your campsite. It's the worst we've ever experienced in a campsite!\n The power outlet is at the front of the stall?.....you will need an extra cord to reach it, at least it was that way for our stall. The person working though, was great and got us a cord to reach the outlet. We tried to book elsewhere while we were there but of course, every place was booked on late notice. Don't stay in the North stalls, the road ways in front of the stalls are gravel, very dusty, no one slows down. The other road ways are paved!",
      "Spend 25 dollars, and get what in return? Push sinks with semi warm water, pay extra for showers, and there's no visible dish sink. Go sleep on the side of the road, you'll pay less and get more",
      "Easy access and quite except for the interstate.  That was ok though. Our neighbors all kept to themselves.  "

      "The campground is small and pretty rustic. Campground owner is extremely nice and accommodating, he let us stay in his field across the street from the campground because we had a large trailer and wouldn't fit in any of the sites. He even let some of our other friends with trailers stay too and still tried to only charge us for one site. But we payed him extra since he was so good to us.",
      "One of the best nights of sleep in weeks. Nice and quiet, with the river roaring you to sleep, plus it was nice and shady in the morning. Bob, the owner is awesome and very laid back. There's a port-o-potty and recycling/trash, but no running water - however there's some available down the street. For $10/night it's a steal anyways. Even if the grounds are full, Bob will find a place for you - he mentioned overflow camping across the street. You won't be turned away!",

      "It's a decent campground. The view is nice . It was very quiet. There are some full time trailers but you don't really notice them. It is 10 minutes from Town. We didn't talk to a single employee. Booked on line . There was a clip board out side the office with our site number on it, and no need to check in when leaving. The privacy between sites is zero, but they are kinda staggered so you get a little off set. We did not use the shower house's or washrooms .",
      "After reading the reviews, I feel lucky that I had a fantastic experience at Whistler RV. I went tent camping with my husband, my 5 year-old girl and an 8 month-old boy. We also noted that we had a large tent when booking in addition to having child and infant. The campground placed us with a large pad, beautiful tall trees at the background, and pretty close to the bathroom.  Can't ask for a better site for our family.  Customer service, they responded to my email query about fire ban and propane fire pit within couple hours and were courteous.",
      "Negatives:\nThere's more permanent residents there than campers. The Frisbee golf doesn't exist, all that's left are a few numbers on trees. The waste hook-ups are badly designed, who's idea was it to set them 1 foot above ground? Kinda defeats the point of hooking your RV up to them as you have to go out and empty the pipe making sure you don't splash poop on yourself. Speaking of poop, there was dog poop everywhere. \nPositives:\nThe view from the park is awesome. It's quite a big campground and it has full hook-ups.",
      "Totally overpriced for an inexistant service ! The showers are cold, no privacy at all, it just looks like  a big parking lot, and this for more than 45$ ! And on the top of that, you have to pay 11$ extra per day if you want wifi, and there online reservation doesn't work ! The laundry facilities were all not working when we got there... \nGenerally extremely disappointed ! \nSo if you were planning to stay for the night, think about it again, and better check around what's still available.",
      "Never stayed and never will even think about it again. I cancelled 8 days prior to arrival due to forest fires and the road in from our arrival destination was closed. They refused to refund me my money. I would have been better off cancelling the day prior. I would have gotten some sort of refund then. I was trying to be courteous so they could book out our site sooner...They are crooks as far as I'm concerned. I'm sure we were not the only people that cancelled and they were trying to save their profits for the season because of all the fires."

      "The campground is well-tended and a nice facility. It was wonderful to have an abundance of flush toilets, access to fresh water, and those awesome hot showers. With so many visitors staying-at and entering the park via West Glacier, St. Mary offered ease of access but with much less traffic and congestion. Wished the campground had more shade, but it's a trade-off for spectacular views of Lewis Range for both sunrise and sunsets. With the right expectations, you will be very pleased with St. Mary Campground.",
      "Nice campground. Found it a little bit tight for our 35 foot trailer. Had to try a few sites before we found one that worked",
      "The best located campground in glacier and it's cheap!  Very well run, private sites, and awesome ranger led talks in the campground!",
      "Wow, what a great location for tent camping. Not only can you see the mountains 24 hours a day, but you're close to the river, which apparently a curious moose cow wanders up from regularly, though we never got to see her. There are all types of campsites, but we chose one that was hemmed in by thick vegetation to minimize having to see our neighbors endeavors. The thick brush was home to numerous birds, including a hummingbird visiting the dense stand of phlox growing between campsites. Lots of woodpeckers, chickadees, and nuthatches, plus a Least Chipmunk venturing out to look for leftovers...sorry little buddy, but this is bear country, so we ran an extra clean camp!",
      "Stayed here when primitive, has awesome views. There was only a hand full of people here at the same time so nice and quiet. Obviously limited facilities with only one long drop toilet open and no water but not an issue."

      "It's a fine campground. The 1-star review by Christopher Lipphardt was meant for Lone Fir Resort in Cougar, WA. Unfortunately it's been cross-posted here  by mistake. (I've flagged it as \"off-topic\" - closest I could get.)",
      "Great USFS campground just off Hwy 20, about 35 miles west of Winthrop, and right outside North Cascades Nat'l Park. Good place to camp if you want to do some hiking and exploring in the Ross and Diablo Lakes areas.",
      "Got to Lone Fir ahead of my group to grab a first come, first serve site. After fully paying for the site for 4 days x $17 = $68, putting the tag up and go out to see WA pass for the afternoon, I came back to someone backing in an RV because the Ranger had come by and pulled the ticket. I followed all the rules, fully paid, but pulled site tab anyway. I haven't gotten any response from the Ranger station, left multiple voicemails, but no one seems to care. \nAnd there is no running water, no camp host and the bathroom ran out of TP. This is the worst experience I've ever had at a NF campground and I routinely camp & climb year round. And all of this over 4th July weekend, the busiest of all.",
      "28 yr Active Duty military, family camper, and world traveler here...Please Do NOT spend your money here.  It's not possible to fully explain my disappointment with the facilities and the owner.  I reviewed other customer reviews before submitting this, and I see a trend with ownership (Jeremy's) attitude towards his customers.  \n    I've never been to a campground that felt so much like a prison camp.  If you have a family with kids or dogs then be prepared for the owner, Jeremy, to loiter around your site and issue you a stern threat of \"kicking you out without a refund\" if there is any noise made after 10pm.  He is intolerant of any noise he can hear.  We found him standing in the dark near our site multiple times trying to eavesdrop...pretty creepy.\n    The RV sites are packed together with fire pits in the strangest locations.  This results in your campfire being behind your back bumper and often 5-10 ft away from your neighbors fire or camper.  There is only one restroom for the entire park, there aren't enough toilets/showers...and it was disgusting every time.   The campground is right next to the highway and you will be forced to hear/watch logging trucks and 4x4s blast by at high speed all night.  The \"free\" wireless is worthless and if you're there when it rains...expect 1-4 inch deep standing water throughout your site.  \n     We had 5 RV's leave the campground early and we refuse to return.  The night before we left I tried giving Jeremy honest helpful feedback...my tone was friendly and calm, but Jeremy became irate and began yelling.  He refused to listen and responded like a petulant child instead of a grown adult.  After he knew we were leaving he then said we were kicked out for being noisy, but admitted that nobody had complained of noise once.  He even went as far as insulting my military service.  Truly disappointed."

      "We stayed the last week of September 2017. I've never stayed in a more beautiful camp, especially for the money. It is well manicured while still felling natural. If the Smurfs ever manage a campground, this is it, magical!  Radium hot springs pool & spa is only ten minutes away.  It's great for recharging & relaxing after a long day trip as it's open some seasons until 11 pm!\n\nCanyon RV Resort is the perfect launching point for day trips to the more expensive to stay at Banff & Chateau Lake Louise areas. Plus you get the gorgeous 90 plus minute drive. The exact drive time will vary depending on how much your crew stops to explore!  There are a dozen places to stop along the way to look out or hike along the emerald green Bow river on the way north to Lake Louise.",
      "Treated badly by owner, because we had reserved and then asked if they would have a site available by the creek when we arrived, even though we hadn't requested it in our reservation request. We were put in site#3 which was barely long enough for our fifth wheel and although we had stated in our request that we had slides the site wasn't wide enough. Because the owner felt that my husband \"embarrassed her ' in the office by asking, she stomps down to the inferior site to continue the argument. When I asked her where we should park the truck she said on the grass, even tho right on the rules it says not even to put a mat on the grass and park on the patio so our slide would fit. We were ready to  unhook and she evicted us! We had accepted the site but she needed to be right and win! She said she had told us on our confirmation that it twas site three, well it's hard to tell what the site is truly like until you get there! Make sure you ask for EVERYTHING you want when you reserve so you don't upset the owner!  UNBELIEVABLE !!! hissy fit! Seen her upset before with  another patron and was crying and complaining to me outside my truck window because he yelled at her, which was unprofessional, to involve me because her feelings were hurt.",
      "Let's get this out of the way first... Yes, the toilets and showers are clean. In fact they sparkle. Day or night they were always clean and fresh.\n\nWe visited the Canyon RV Resort near the end of July 2017 at the end of our trip across western Canada.\n\nThe resort is a beautiful place to have a relaxing break.  The tin lids will love it. A beautiful shallow stream runs through the middle of park creating a dream playground for the adventurous ones.  For those less adventurous it is a wounderful setting for an evening stroll, crossing back and forth over the babbling brook as you work your way from one end of the park to the other.\n\nThe sites are generously sized. Many back right on to the stream creating a very relaxed and pleasant atmosphere.  We stayed in \"Site #0\" - a perfect sized spot for our little RV.  Having stayed at the park, a site next to the stream will be our choice next time.\n\nThe park is lovingly maintained and is always clean. Not once did we spot a single piece of litter. There were lots of dogs in the park, however they are always on a lead and I don't recall hearing a single bark.\n\nCheck out the photos - they don't lie.  This is a beautiful resort with great managers and an obviously devoted and caring team.\n\nBrian J & Sherry T\nSydney, Australia",
      "Delightful site, good showers, laundry, very helpful staff. Trees and pretty planting, hard roads, no dust.\nBrook running through site disguises any noise there may be from road.\nWish we could clone it and install other places.\nBest site on our Canada trip so far.\nPity it was raining!!!",

      "Nicest RV Park in Fairbanks.  Stayed 6 weeks, close to town and convenient to Fred Meyer shopping.  RV Park is part of the larger complex of cottages and restaurant.  The Restaurant/Bar on site is Chena Alaska Grill.  Food is a little pricey but really good.  They have a nice deck for dining as well.  Easy walk to Pikes Landing Restaurant for less expensive food.  Pikes also has a deck on the River.  The Princess Lodge is 1/2 way between the RV Park and Pikes, they have a restaurant and bar as well.  WIFI was excellent.  Cable was horrible, couldn't watch it at our site because it was so fuzzy.  Owners need to clear out or cut up and back the trees on the sites as well as get rid of the sticker bushes that are along some sites.  Seems like the owners also need to capitalize on the riverbank and build it up so guest have a comfortable place to sit and watch the river go buy.   We paid $52 a night in July and August.  Manager is very friendly and helpful.  Would stay again.",

Many campgrounds were closed for the season and I'm so glad we found this place with their hours posted online. The office had two adorable dogs and a cat ready for affection. The site itself was nice - full hookups for a very decent price. We didn't have the right type of plug and the office actually carried an adaptor and helped us out (it was free to borrow, but we ended up buying it in case of use in the future). The bathrooms were pristine and the showers so warm and steamy (and free!) - perfect for a cold autumn night. Clayton even gave us a few bulbs of fresh garlic from his friend's place, which we happily used to cook dinner :) Overall fantastic place to stay.",
      "Pros:Friendly staff, nice bathroom and laundry facilities.  WiFi, water, power. \nCons: You're going to be camping between the trans Canada highway, and a rail line.  Don't expect absolute serenity, but it's does die down overnight. \n Previous comments have stated too, there's a high percentage of long-term residents.  \n\nOverall good place, and good price.\n\n",
      "Strange mix at this place. On the plus side the location is convenient, the bathrooms were clean with good water pressure, great internet connection. On the negative side... well, it was a bit creepy. Almost all the sites seem to be permanent residents, the residences near by are scary. Frankly, I would my let my kids wander around.

      "I have been to this place few times and had s good time, by my last visit on October 1st was by far the worst at any place. The staff one person in particular looked like he was staying there and we were serving him, he was arrogant rude and the way he spoke was as though he was doing us a favour. We order food and it comes after 2 hours and 30 mins. We ask for an extra glass at 10 30 and he says kitchen is closed how does it matter if the kitchen is closed for an extra glass? That guys attitude was that we were staying at the place for free . One good thing is that they were very timely in collecting money. They get the food and he was like pay now.. the next day when we asked for whats available to eat for lunch he said this the same thing we got you yesterday night we ll make the same.. I really think the staff needs to be taught some manners. May be u as to pay upfront the entire amount cos u know that it doesn't matter what the guests feel as long as you have got the money. My recommendation go there and experience if u want to know what I have stated is true or not. Their standards have dropped from okay to worst .",
      "Although I've been here a couple of times because of the warmth and the beauty of the place..  My most recent stay here was terrible. The food and the service is very poor. The staff was very rude. I will never be going to this place ever again. Wish I could give it 0 stars! Disappointed!",

      "I recently visited this resort in Anjanapura, Bangalore. It is very peace and quite atmosphere resort with green shades around. I felt Capital Club Resort is one of the best place for the people who are planning for a day out or stay in a serenity resort for a day or few. The best place for spending summer or vacation or weekends with family / kids or friends.\n\nIt has a nice and small swimming pool for adult and an another small one for kids. The park, indoor and outdoor games all are good. The best place to visit and stay to remember it for a long.\n\nBannerghatta National Park to Capital Club Resort distance is around 10kms, so, visitors can enjoy the surrounding and National Park.",

Clean and nicely set up grounds, a little populated on weekends, but for good reason. Best for the families who are looking to have a perfect weekend getaway. Awesome overall and very family friendly.",
      "Our experience at Gold Coin resorts was wonderful! Firstly the room you provided was very comfortable and good and from there we had breakfast which is awesome and the chef was also very good to us.Then we went to the grounds for Adventures events where we have yogi to guide and made us to do those events with joyfully . Out of 5 I will give 5 rating to yogi as he was very friendly and welcoming till the end guiding us .After that we had delicious lunch . And then swimming pool there we enjoyed to peaks . We were very happy for all those you have provided us.Afer that unexpected raindance which is very good for the people to enjoy more and  followed by tea and snacks .Then yogi bought BBQ yummy chicken .  Now the most wonderful experience we had was tents, that was nice feeling when it was raining and we were sleeping inside the tent but before that campfire was such  beautiful thing we had in resorts. We had delicious food over there and Finally hospitality is very good. We hope to return again!",

      "Had the first trek of my life with the wanderers. The trek, the railway tracks amongst the greenery, the night camp besides the waterfall and on top of that the enthusiastic and fun loving company I got to trek with...in one word it was just Awesome. Weekends are always good when they are spent far away from the hustle and bustle of our day to day corporate lives. Trekking to a wild green location is one among those \"get-away\" options and the experience becomes memorable when you get like minded people to explore with. \nLooking forward for more such treks with the wanderers. :)",
      "Great company, informal settings and some awesome trails. I have been going out with the group before they founded this company and their enthusiasm and spirit are as strong as ever. Highly recommended!",
      "Felt the trek was very well planned and everything fell in place - as in the weather was awesome, and we got to enjoy it more because most part of the trek was done the second day. To add to it, the people were all very friendly -  never felt that I met them for the first time. Really glad that I went up to the peak with such wonderful company. \nKudos especially to Mr. Chandu, to make it memorable (please, who will forget the 45 mins maggi :D with the Somalia kids waiting around eagerly)",
      "Narasimha Parvata is my 5th Trek with WW since Dec 2011, others being Tadiyandamol, KP, Kudremukh & Mulayanagiri - Baba Budangiri...The best part about WW is that even a first time trekker will feel he is trekking with friends and not a service provider , as such!! Mainly cos of Chandu's friendly ways and his constant PJ's..:-) Have made a lot of friends who we keep bumping into one trek or the other!  NP was organized well as usual, the breakfast being an additional bonus! The trek was a little different with the first 3 hours walking in dense forests and next part being a gradual climb. The climb was challenging, (more so due to my lack of fitness :-) ). The usual suspect & saviour i.e. Maggi made its mandatory appearance! This time, it had company in the form of soup , making the dinner actually heavy on top of NP! The so-called guesthouse on the summit was a luxury for trekkers ..... The guide , Thimmappa, was friendly and told me a lot of stories. Made more new friends whom am sure will bump into again and again!

      "Breakfast was good. Lunch was not that great as less variety of dishes and the taste was not that great. Water sports is ok. Rope activity and rappelling are not that difficult. If you're looking for adventurous activities, not a good place to visit.\nWill have to walk for 10 to 15 minutes to the camp site from the parking spot.",
      "One of the worst places I've been to in my life. 1. Common rest rooms (the only ones available for guests) weren't cleaned the entire day even once, the stench was unbearable. 2. Safety gear including life jackets were torn and not maintained well - I'm afraid an untoward incident is at the brink of an actual incident. 3. Food was poor, chicken rubbery and hard. (I'm sure each chicken weighed over 2kgs). 4. Bedding and bed sheets for the tent house was filthy. 5. Tent was equally bad. 6. There was no mobile signal 7. Not a single security guard was present 8. I'm ashamed to even point out non availability of a single chair for the guests. Our entire team of 45 didn't stay back due to the above points. Overall I'd give them 1 point out of 10. \n\nLet me remind you that this wasn't an exaggeration.  Take your own risk and enjoy this facility.",
      "Nice place for Team outings. Road is up-to Dobbaguli. Parking is in side by one of the form/field(Open space). No dedicated parking place from Camp.  From parking 1 Km walk to reach River(Camp). Route is good for trekking. But needs to be careful in few places while walking.  Food is good. Water they will be getting from near by stores(Cans). One best thing I observed is they are using Solar Power for their daily needs.",
      "Awesome place... adventure guaranteed...at a very good location, while kayaking you get a breathtaking view of Kunti betta. Rope activities are a must.",
      "Scenic, but not safe when you go to water. The activities are interesting with rappelling, rock climbing, swimming, kayaking etc. However, they need to add better safety precautions in check list - like explaining everyone about safety measures well in advance before jumping into water. The safety boat should be all time ready as the boats easily get toppled in the water, tough with life jackets on, not much concerns. Food is left desirable. But overall, a good outing with family or team for a day out. Best part is being in water."

Large common/sitting room and ample indoor kitchen facilities for campers, huge laundry area, large clean toilet and shower facilities. Fresh water, bins, grey and black water disposal points all available even if you arrive late without booking in advance.  Would recommend to any tourer visiting the area to book on here for their stay.  Town is a nice easy walk, with plenty of takeaways, pubs, restaurants, shops, Saint Magnus Cathedral and both distilleries are also walkable.",
      "Great facilities, this campsite has individual bathrooms that can't be faulted.  The site is nicely laid out in small areas and is only ten minutes walk from the shops and cathedral in Kirkwall.  The lake and harbour are nearby too and lovely to walk around.",
      "Really good site, well laid out and good spaces between pitches. Site website says that vans should be less than 7m long. This is only a guide with many of the pitches able to take somewhat longer units. Great location from which to see the usual sites. ",
      "We arrived off the aberdeen ferry at 11pm having checked twice that this would not be a problem. However I should have heeded a previous review saying they had arrived and someone was already in their pitch. We had to park outside the site in late arrivals with no electricity. We eventually got on to our paid for pitch at 11am. Not a great start. \nThe toilets were great always open. Nice having the toilet and shower in the same cubical. \nLots of tents. We were in a caravan. Everyone very friendly.\nGood site for access to all areas of Orkney. Nice walk on to town takes 10 min. Pickaquey Centre great for cinema and breakfast ! \n\n",

      "This is a lovely little site, especially for campervans and caravans looking for a night or two near (but outside) of John O’Groats. I parked on the gravel area at the front, and was thrilled to have EHU and a heated facility block for a VERY reasonable fee. Happy to pay cash at this small site. The site facilities were clearly created with love and care, and continue to be maintained in the same fashion.\n\nWe dropped in one tea-time, very pleased to spot a site that was open in October while doing a late season NC500 circuit. \n\nOK so there’s only one shower and two toilets for each gender… but that’s plenty. The shower have large changing areas with heaters, benches, lot of hooks etc. The shower instructions tell you how to get the best out of them and promise up to 10 minutes of hot water. I can’t imagine needing any longer. Not only is there a hand drier in the ladies, but also a hairdryer and a standard electrical socket- facilities that many commercial sites don’t bother with. Oh and HEATING !!! I cannot say enough about how well built and equipped the site facilities are, how clean they are… not a cobweb in sight, and the plushest loo roll of any campsite I’ve visited in Scotland!\n\nRoad noise? Ha ! There’s not much traffic on this road through the evening/night.",

      "Just spent four nights at Mannix Point -an absolutely fantastic location - AMAZING site with every facility on site - spotless - very friendly lads in reception and very reasonable rates - best showers in any campsite! - neither my son or I wanted to leave this morning, would happily spend weeks on end there!! Will be back and highly recommend others to visit!",
      "We parked our van up for a night in Mannix Point when travelling last week. What an amazing campsite not only for the immaculate facilities but the friendly warm atmosphere around the camp. The large kitchen was a special addition to our travels as it allowed us to cook up a feast comfortably. Highlights were listening to lyric fm in the shower and being surrounded by beautiful plants and flowers. \n\nCouldn't reccomend this campsite more if you're travelling in the area!  🏕",
      "Again, another fabulous stay at Mannix point. Stayed for nine nights during the Caherciveen festival. The weather was mixed, but we didn't care. The atmosphere was great!!!. Third year and there will be a fourth. Got our Valentia setting. Thankyou Mortimer and your great team. 🙌🍹🎊",

      "We were visiting this hostel mid October 2017 (my partner was here before). It was a unique visit as storm Brian was raging through Kerry. We a good experience in the hostel. We could light the fire, it was clean, hot water, plenty of space in the fridge. \nOne thing could improve to have a bit more heating during the night. The heating was completely off between 10pm and 7am and it was stormy outside. \nOtherwise, we will be back next year as we could go to Blasket Islands as the sailing was cancelled due to the storm.",
      "Really great atmosphere - met lots of other walkers and backpackers, gave the place a great feel. Staff were all really helpful and nice. €10p/p for camping (which in my opinion is the cheaper end of standard prices in Ireland), €18 for a dorm bed and €24p/p for a private room. All these prices are high season too. Great sized kitchen/common room with a lovely rustic feel. 5-10minutes walk from the centre of Dingle. Would recommend to others :) ",
      "Great hostel, very clean and friendly with plenty of space inside and out. Kitchen and living area is large and there's a big BBQ out the back. Good spaces for camping too",
      "Really nice and homely place. We camped and being able to use the facilities was really useful. Turned up without any notice too and could get a spot which was great. Would definitely go again.",
      "Best campsite we've been so far. Everything clean, free barbecue outside(you just have to bring your charcoal, or you can even buy it here for like 3€) price 10€ per person is like 2€ more expensive than anywhere, but its really nice here. Theres also fine place for hammocks."

      "The facilities are not bad and the price for camping is cheap. However, the staff has some of the worst attitude I have ever seen in hospitality and the rooms and food are definitely overpriced for this area and country. The reception staff act like you, the customer, are getting paid to work for them. They want to sit around doing little or nothing and get angry after 1 or 2 questions. The owner tries a little bit to act like he cares and wants them to change there attitudes but ultimately protects and supports them. Then he wastes time trying to show off his expensive cadillac he bought with all the money he takes from tourists. The menu in the restaurant is difficult to understand and it is difficult to get a straight answer from anybody as to what food is available at what time. Not even the owner seems to know. He says one thing, the waiter says something different, and then the waiter changes what he/she says 2 or 3 times again later. It is obvious the waiters and kitchen staff just want to make there job easier by limiting the menu. All a bunch of frustrating nonsense and waste of time. At this price, no thanks. There are a number of other choices in the area. Unless you want to pay a lot for a normal hotel room in the middle of the bush and you can tolerate a lot of nonsense and bad attitude I recommend trying a different place in the area."

A budget camp (no unnecessary frills or glamour) that is set in one of the most pristine settings available in Parvati Valley. 4 Kms short of Kasol and that means away from maddening crowd and noise. 50 metres from a young forest on one side and a fully grown forest on the other side and at a stone's throw from gushing Parvati River. And then is the unmatched hospitality of Ajit/Ajeet bhai ji. Common washrooms are in plenty, are kept painstakingly clean and have 24x7 running hot and cold showers. Finally, Parvin Negi's magical cooking and sipping own amrut sitting around a bonfire with light musik playing in the backdrop......WOW!"

      "The places is still virgin which makes it serene and peaceful. I want to keep it a secret from others but the words has to be said for its beauty. One of the best kept secret of Himalayas. ",
      "awesome experience of trekking and river crossing.superb service and bird watching .it is a great comapany!!!!best in valley",
      "The first time I visited Tirthan valley was in March 2016 for a trek to rangthar, followed by another trek to Rolla...and since the first time have visited 5 times in the past 15 months....Do I need to say more? Well I don't if I wish to give a 5 star rating...\nBut I do need to write more as I wish to give not 5 but 6 stars....\n5 ofcourse for the incomparable, raw natural beauty....the sparkling, effervescent waters of the river Tirthan, the breath taking views of snow clad Himalayas, the walks & treks to and through the pristine Great Himalayan National Park and the total absence of commercialization with only homestays and home run guesthouses for accommodation.\nBut that additional sixth star and perhaps the most important one which has got us back again and again and again is for the way you are made to feel at home in this paradise by the outstanding team of sunshine adventures. The promoters of sunshine - Panki and Ankit...both brothers... Who beyond holding a long list of achievements and contributions in the field of mountaineering and ecotourism are extremely warm individuals giving personal attention to every guest who visits their home..the valley.\nAnd this same warmth passes on to their team who takes care of the guests like no other even on treks, during worst of weather with the limited resources they carry along. I would always remember that time when it was raining hailstones during our rangthar trek and we were confined to our tents and someone called from outside....madam tent kholo chai aur pakode banaaye Hai!!!That truly floored us!! And the best part is this wasn't a one time affair...coz have experienced the same across my 5 visits. Panki and Ankit....you truly are Sunshine brothers for the way you and your  team spreads sunshine in lives of all who visit your valley! Thanks a ton! All the best....and I am sure I will be back soon!! So although there isn't an option to give here....here come my 6 stars!!",
      "There is a lot to say but I will try to confine myself in few words.\n\nMy journey to Great Himalayan National Park(UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITE) was an experience of a lifetime. It was a spiritual journey carried out physically through rappelling, river crossing and trekking to Shilt peak (10000 feet).\n\nPersonally, in last 1 - 1.5kms of trekking, it felt like a test of physical strength, endurance, stamina and mental calmness. I was able to explore myself and discover new horizons.\n\nWe camped at Rolla camp, danced around Bonfire and able to connect with nature. The beauty of the landscape was mesmerizing.\n\nMoreover, I had firsthand experience of SHGs who prepared local cuisine such as DHAAM and SIDDU for us.\n\nI was lucky enough to meet Mr Panki Sood (featured in National Geographic Magazine, adventures, mountaineer, writer, nature photographer, Ecotourism company owner and above all a wonderful person) and Mr Ankit Sood (Phd., working on project sponsored by ADB to promote ecotourism and much more) and Sunshine Himalayan Adventures.... and others who made this trip as a memorable experience.\n\n..... I feel like going again.....\n",

From the great price, 46.00 a night to the water slides, to the amazing sunset. \nWe will make the 7 hour trek back soon for another visit!",
      "This campground is AMAZING!   It is so beautiful with the stone sidewalks around the lakes, the flowers, the trees.  It is perfect for kids...3 water slides going directly in the lake and a BIG one into a basin.  Last year we drove all the way to B.C. and never found a campground like the one in Moonbeam.  The owners and the staff are the best!   We go back every year because it is the nicest campground!",

Some campgrounds have fun activities over weekends; movie nights,  music,  etc.  This one has a volleyball court.... that's all.  You can tube on the river/creek but its pricey with rocky beaches.\n I won't be returning with my family. AND\nI know dogs nicer than the lady at the front desk!",
      "Nice to be able to float the river. But they don't let you bring in wood and then charge for wood. For $35 a night and not even full hook up. And power is low, meter comes to just under green. That was before more campers came in. We just lost power totally. Not our breaker. No power to outside pole. They are looking at it. Views on ridge by pavilion are nice. But over all for $35 nt not a good value. Water is split 4 ways.",

The park is clean, has a beautiful park to walk in and is immaculate.  We highly recommend Spring Meadows for anyone visiting this area!",

Would recommend if looking to park your rv or to rent a trailer. Thanks for great memories and accommodating us.",

They were very accommodating and prompt to respond any time I had any sort of question or need. The on-site laundry facilities are wonderful. Cable & Wi-Fi included in rent.  I would absolutely recommend staying here, hands down!!",

      "Great caravan park. Really well looked after, very friendly and accommodating staff. Long way from nearest shops etc so being things you need. Though the office has a small range of items. Oh and Pizza :). My favourite thing is the open fire they have at night. ",
      "This place is a great little holiday spot especially for families.... Lots of activities for kids... We'll definitely be coming back in the warmer months... ",
      "BEWARE! GRUMPY, UNWELCOMING CARETAKER!! The park is nice. In a quaint setting with some fairly good facilities. It is just a shame the caretaker is a grumpy man who is hellbent on stamping out any fun that anyone is having. We were there for a family reunion and everyone was having a lovely time in the dining area. No one was being loud at all. All of a sudden the lights went out at 10.30pm with no warning, even though it said the area was open until 11pm (both nights). One of our party was nearly seriously injured because they couldn't see their way back to their cabin. He then came and banged on a table near one of our cabins to 'try' and quieten down the noise. People in these kinds of positions should be of a pleasant disposition and should make guests feel welcome. Probably won't return solely for this reason, which is a shame, because we live close and would probably frequent there regularly otherwise.",

      "Great place for views. Huge lake. Very steep and a long way to very old and unclean amenities. Downright dangerous trying to get to the amenities due to hilly terrain, rabbit holes and pot holes and poor lighting at night. Had to pay extra for dragon boat  weekend but no dragon boats and park not busy. Only one amenities block for huge park. This place could be spectacular but needs a lot of maintenance and some loving care. Had to ask for bins to be emptied. Dead rabbits just left to rot. The herb garden and camp bbq area showed someone cares.  The garden around the cafe was lovely and the only other part showing any care but didnt carry through to kitchen unfortunately. Breakfast for 2 cost over $50 and couldn't eat hard poached eggs or water saturated toast. Overall the only thing going for this park is the views and park management can't spoil that.",
      "Nice caravan park, but located on a slope. Powered sites seem flatter and more scenic than unpowered for only $3 more. Have to remember the shower block door code - hard to do in middle of the night. Shared kitchen facilities are very good.",

      "Peace & tranquility \n\nPark layout is really interesting. None of this row after row.The Park is located on a hill and layout designed so that you are never sitting outside under ur annex looking at the side of your car or another van. \n\nWhere ever your allocated site is, you'll have breathtakingly gorgeous views of Lake Hume and the mountains (& in winter two snow peaks)\n\nVery clean amenities. \n\nLovely little cafe with an ice-cream bar 🍦🍦serving a decent all day breaky (hubby's favorite 😋) and a nice assortment of meals for all the starving and light appitites.\n\nLots to see and do at the park and the surrounds. \n\nWe were staying 5 nights and doubled it to 10 😀... think we'll be back 👍\n\n(My shared photos are copyrighted to myself, Mary Coulstock.

      "So many vantage points. \nGreat photography opportunities. \nGood fishing and water sports. \nFantastic picnic areas with wide open spaces.  \nCouncil provided BBQs scattered around the lake at picnic spots. \nLots of Historically significant areas. Worth a stopping to read dedicaton plaques.\nA must is a visit to the Immigrant Centre. It's fascinating. Staff are very helpful and there are some uniquely memorable souvenirs to admire/purchase including books with historic significance to the area and to the families genealogy. Think we'll be visiting there again 😀",

The water started hot but went cold again, I had to jump out of it, freezing!  We had to go so told the guy at the reception who was the same person to fix it. He told me I should have waited half an hour after my husband finished. No apologies, poor customer service from him.\nHowever, the lady that checked us in the night before was helpful and friendly.

Prior to the trip we were impressed with the information and advice we were given. When we arrived at Camp we met Prashant Bhai & two other people, who was extremely helpful and ensured that we enjoyed the trip and looked after all our needs. The trek itself was an amazing experience. We would like to especially thank Prashant Bhai and his fellow members for providing such a great experience, and would recommend High Mountain Trekking Camp\nOur trek weather was generally sunny. The temperature was pleasant for walking in the daytime, but it was cold when the sun went down. The food was Awesome, however we had no complaints and all our food was included in the price of the trip which made it very easy and great value for money and the prices are really affordable. I would love to go again."

Oczywiście dostaliśmy solidne kamizelki ratunkowe.  \nNa miejscu znajdziecie dużo miejsca na grillowanie, leżakowanie i łomżyng pod parasolką.

If that is a requirement for you than you should avoid this place.  \nPros: Animation and most staff are friendly - pools are nice - beach is nice -\nCons:  Of the 4 doors in my trailer 3 were broken - you are required to pay for cleaning and still need to clean the place before you can move in as their idea of cleaning is a quick sweep mom and wipe the counter - the showers and toilet are gross - dogs everywhere as they no longer have designated areas for dogs - trailer smelled like wet dog (requested a trailer in a dog free zone and they said no problem but when they dont have dog free zones they tried to tell me that the trailer had no dogs previously but the smell was the tell.  Customer no service \"Im sorry thats terrible but enjoy your stay\" . I am pretty sure all of the employees are terrified of the \"Director\" as they all walk on eggshells around him.  This was our second and last trip here.",
      "Excellent camping! Friendly staff, perfect animation for kids of all ages in the day and evening.(Disco, beach party, fireworks, sport tournaments etc etc...) Allot of sport facility's(Soccer 2x, tennis, volleybal, fitness)  verry nice and clean pools, nice beach. Diving school( With nice and friendly dog assistent�) that has good prices. Introduction dive in the pool for 5 euro. Good food(especially the pizza's) also for a good price. Drinks also reasonable priced. Go out for a night in The Netherlands and you pay more for your coctails. Supermarket with everything you need for  reasonable prices for a campingshop. Payd allot more at supermarkets on other campings. Maybe the big supermarket 25 min away is cheaper, but if you drive over there with the car it also includes diesel costs and you can enjoy your holiday for 50 minutes less because of the drive to the supermarket and back,  so you can better shop at the campingshop and it will cost you nothing extra.\nOutside of the camping is not so much to do, but we knew this before we booked. For us not a big problem because by car you can go everywhere! Chioggia is verry nice and 1 hour drive, venice 1.5 hour, ferrara 1 hour 20 min. also aquaparks in about 1.5 hour drive from the camping. So enough to do by car.\nYes there are allot of musquitoes, but that's normal over here because of the delta. It's nature! Campings sprays against it 3x a week, but advice is to take also something with you to protect your self a little bit more against them.",

This place gets 2 stars for the nice animation team and friendly staff but lacks 3 for not fixing broken doors , having dirty trailers, barking dogs and wet dogs that are allover your trailer before you arrive making everything smell very bad inside.",

      "My first impression was that this camping is somewhat dated and with not too much of an offering. At the end it was very adequate for our needs and we had a good time here with our kids of 1 and 4 years of age. The installations is somewhat of age, but generally working, hygienic spaces are kept clean and tidy. Staff is friendly, I get the impression the place is family driven. As you enter the camping, it is not huge, there are some spots with protection from wind and sun. Closer to the beach there is more attractive spots, but less protected to the weather. The camping have direct access to the beach and run a banja of it's own (deck chair is charged extra). Chioggia is a comfortable 30 minute walk away. There is no traffic noise. Saturday and Sunday there is a loud beach party at a nearby club, ending at midnight  (free entrance). Main attraction for our kids is the playground at the beach, apart from beach itself. To us the main attraction is to have things within good range, at the same time a quiet spot.",

      "BED BUGS!!!!!!! \n\nWe stayed 4 nights in Camping Rialto and it was the worst experience we have had our WHOLE Europe trip and we have been budget travelling for 4 months now. We slowly kept getting bites all over our body every night but we thought that is was mosquito bites as we did not wear any repellent. Every night it would get worse even though we left the window and door closed of our cabin 24/7 (which was extremely annoying due to the fact that the cabins are like a sauna and about 10 degrees hotter then outside which was already very hot) by the 3rd morning we woke up absolutely covered in hundreds of bites which were swollen. We found live bugs AND blood stains all over the bed sheets from the bed bugs (which were not there the first night)! Went immediately to reception who sent someone to check and it was confirmed (obviously). All the reception offered for a solution was to move rooms.. no apologies, no help to get rid of the infestation which would now be over all of our belongings and no assistance on our horrible bites. Instead I got told  in an extremely rude loud manner that is was OUR fault for bringing the bugs in apparently which is most definitely not the case as we did not have any bed bug problems in any of our previous accommodation. And then it was also our fault because he left it three days instead of coming to them when we thought it was mosquito bites.. as I explained to the bigger lady that I didn't come tell reception because i thought it was mosquito bites she told me that was my fault because I should have told her we were getting bitten by mosquitoes .. I was gob smacked. Would strongly recommend NOT to stay here! Your better off spending a few extra euros and getting something nicer instead on spending it on expensive creams for the bites."

      "A fantastic campsite. The situation and location make it perfect for Venice - just a boat ride away. But it's much more than a great location. The site itself is well laid out, with pitches of various sizes and types. The camping facilities are really, really good, with great showers and toilets and washing up and laundry and motorhome servicing. There's a good shop with plenty of range and good prices. \n\nBut best of all is the team who work there. They make a huge effort, and it shows. Everything is clean and tidy and well maintained. The reception desk are polite and helpful. In practical terms, they lay on a shuttle bus to meet the ferries to Venice in the mornings and evenings, plus in season they run to the beach too. They sell ferry tickets, post your letters and generally make for a great stay.\n\nA very, very well recommended campsite. Well worthy of five stars.\n\nThey also have a restaurant a few metres from the entrance, which does good food, including gluten free pasta options for those that want to enjoy it. ",
      "Clean & cozy camping with private spots. Free hot showers, toilet paper. Wifi costs additional 3 euros for one person. Nice pool & minimarket with anything you need, very helpful staff with getting aroung. Enjoyed 5 nights there.The only drawback was missing a fan.",
      "Rude and completely unhelpful receptionists, were not competent enough to present an offer with prices neither in English nor in German",
      "Great location, clean, very nice service. It takes over 40 minutes to get to Venice by boat and the daily boat tickets are 20 eur per person (even kids have to pay). ",

      "Back for our 5th stay; I think that nearly says it all! Staying in a Bungalow Comfort this time around, which is, indeed, very comfortable. Staff are very helpful and have much better English than my Italian (I do keep trying Italian!). We're very nearly at the end of the campsite so it's a good ten minute walk to the shop and restaurant so we've hired bikes with baskets to make getting around quicker. The shop is very well stocked, including gluten free items and if you're lazy (like me) it will probably have everything you need for a 2 week stay. Some things are very cheap (wine) but others can be found cheaper in the supermarket a twenty minute walk / 5 minutes drive away. All in all, I love this place and already thinking about coming back next year as they are building a new reception/restaurant/shop which looks like it will be pretty fabulous when finished. ",
      "Like many campsites in this part of Italy, Ca'Savio is also an over-crowded 'camping factory'. There are about 1500 pitches, divided into stands and lanes. Be aware not to hit your tent pegs through your neighbours tent! No privacy here and people speak German in stead of Italian...\nThe sanitary facilities are very basic, no toilet seats to be found on this campsite. I have to say that the campsite was cleaned fairly well for such a crowded place. Some positive notes: Enough space in the swimming pools, day trips can be arranged here and the camp store has lots to offer. \nConclusion: Such a crowded place is not my cup of tea, but a visit to Venice (nice and quick boat trip) and some days at the sea it is an affordable stopover, but there are many more beautiful and quiet places to be found in Italy.",
      "Had an amazing 2 weeks here with my family. Great location, lovely staff and all the facilities you could want. We will be back!",
      "Beautiful spot right beside a golden beach . Restaurant tasty reasonably priced food. Facilities were very good, pools,pizzerias and super market. Shaded by forest. CA Savio sweet market twice a week. Regular bus to ferry to Venice. ",
      "Good facilities, pools, the service personnel are professional and very nice. Good prices for accommodation. Check the campsites own website and book there directly. "

      "The place is not very friendly, staff does not smile, not a word of english is spoken so it makes you feel rather unwelcoming. We intended to book a mobilehome for a week, were told they are sold out so went for the more expensive bungalow. However during our whole stay 3 mobile homes were empty. No answer at all followed our written complaint.  Every evening before going to bed we had to chase the mosquitos in the bedrooms, otherwise we all woke up with tons of red dots on us. Cant be that hard to put insect nets on the windows! Altough the camp is near the beach, it is a very long walk before you reach the sea. \nThe area is very nice though and not too busy the first week of september. Great to have bikes with child seats, then you can explore it easily. \n",

      "We spent 5 nights in a family tent in July 2017, a very positive experience: \n+ Friendly staff\n+ Shady camping area (the trees are cropped especially to provide shade)\n+ Great facilities including a pool, a beach, a restaurant, a shop, and sports fields\n+ Very clean and well maintained\n+ Decent wifi even in camping area\n+ Cabins of various sizes available.\nThe only things we didn't like were the mosquitoes and the party noise coming from the neighbouring camping late into the night - but these are beyond the control of Camping Miramare.  \nThank you - we will be back!",
      "This site is OK. The staff are helpful and friendly, the receptionist speaks very good English. The shower block and toilets are clean, but there is no toilet paper! Unfortunately the wifi is NOT free. The pool is alright. The beach is not so good, my family thought there wasn't something quite right about the water. The main reason we booked this site was because it is near to Venice though. To get there you should go by boat, there is a direct private one which only goes once a day at 14 euros per person. I recommend the public one, the tourist pass is 20 euros per person for a day. This includes buses and water buses all around Venice and there are plenty of sailings. The journey to Venice takes over an hour, but it is enjoyable. This site is ideal for Venice, not so ideal for the beach. ",
      "We stayed for 1 week in September 2016. \nSanitary was super-clean at any time. Beautiful private beach, but no local staff to receive rented umbrella and sunbdeds, return to reception to ask for assistane, not that bad as a walk through the campsite is nice. 😊\nGood restaurant with great pizza and pasta. \nMaybe you can add bruschetta to the menu? We love bruschetta 😍😍😍\nFriendly staff and good service. \nOnly negative point is that Extras are to high priced. Wifi which is much much too expensive. On most campsites throughout Europe Wifi is not more than 5 EUR / 7 days or even for free. Maybe some change here for next summer....we will be back 😍😍😍😍😍😍",

We paid approximately 20000 for this and when we reached there the camp people said that we don't have any booking from you. We had to stay in a different camp and pay again for the stay which we have already paid for...people in Ladakh are nice but these guys are exceptions and they should be left alone",

All the arrangements made was more than satisfactory as they treated us more like a family member then their customer. Mr. Naushad was prompt and very responsive at his end while he provided us with Scorpio and the driver was very much experienced and confident one, though we would be afraid to see the narrow rough hilly roads ahead of us, we totally enjoyed the ride. Also, the lodging and camps in Keylong and Sarchu were  neat and clean. Coming to food, many options were available for breakfast and dinner according to your choice like breakfast itself had bread,butter, jam, chappati, milk, oats, omlet, tea or coffee anything and dinner was also superb. At the end, I must say.. Those places are indeed worth visit a lifetime but what makes it more beautiful is when you are treated really well and everything goes with your expectations.",

      "Wouldn't suggest anyone to camp at Sarchu. An elevation of roughly 16000ft makes oxygen scarce. Cold and windy desert conditions will test your physical and emotional being. There are a few tenting accomodations but they are basic. Unfortunately, Sarchu is the only halt option in between Jispa and Leh on Manali Leh route. So cannot do without it unless you would want to do 350 plus kilometres in a day.",
      "DO NOT STAY HERE - Nothing against this beautiful place, but it is the hotbed of AMS. If you climb from Manali - It’s a sudden 2000+ meters climb and spending a night over here is an open invite for ACute Mountain Sickness. \n\nAlthough AMS is very talked subject while taking this route, one must understand that this is a very SERIOUS concern. Any ignorance can be fatal.\n\nNo mobile network here. There is a satellite phone with Army post over there.",

The oxygen level is very low so most of the time people suffers from the mountain sickness problem. So always take oxygen tablet (\"Dimox\") in regular interval.

You can rent a tent for 60tl or with your own tent for 40tl. The market has only dusty things witch costs 50% more... Alsow the stuff is not so friendly.

      "Güzel bir kamp alanı. Elektriğiniz var. Marketiniz, manavınız var. Ortak kullanım buzdolaplarınız var. Bulaşıkhaneniz var. Sadece günü birlik de gidebileceğiniz bir yer. Çadır kurarsanız bana göre aşağıda daha sağ tarafları tercih etmeniz yönünde. Ağaçların altı doğal olarak gölge ve serin oluyor. Denize sıfır bir yer bulursanız da çok daha güzel oluyor. Tabi bu arada: Ne aradığınıza göre değişir ! Ev hijyeni, ev konforu, orman sessizliği vs bulamazsınız. Ama! Tuvalet var, ve TEMİZ. Ortak kullanılan bir tuvalete göre evet temiz. Kullananlar da birbirlerine saygı gösterseler daha da temiz olur aslında. Duşlar var ve çalışıyor. Sabahları bir ekip mıntıka temizliği yapıyor. Deniz kıyısının tamamı ince kum / kumsal. Denizin içi ise sahil şeridinin %80 ninde kum. Açıklara giderseniz de anlarsınız açık renkli kum. Bu yüzden deniz daha açık renkli görünüyor kıyı kesimlerinde açıklara oranla. Akşam üzeri sahilden oltayla balık tutabilirsiniz. Sabahın ilk saatlerinde zıpkınla balık avlayabilirsiniz. Yani eğer ki; hijyen delisi değilseniz, börtü-böcek fazla canınızı sıkmıyorsa, arılar ve ya sinekler için doğal korunma yöntemleri bilginiz varsa, çadır kurmayı öğrendikten sonra ateş yakmayı da biliyorsanız; emin olun siz de bu kampı seveceksiniz."

      "Her yıl en az bir kere gitmeye çalıştığım bir kamp alanı. Sahibi Ahmet abinin tavrı sizin ona yaklaşımınıza göre değişir. Mesela sen tek kişi 6 kişilik çadırda kalmak istiyorsan taban alanını kapladığı için tabi ki 6 kişi parası alacak. Bu aynen otele gittiğinizde büyük suitte kaldığınızda oda parasının tamamını almaları gibi düşünün. Avrupa'da ki kampinglerde kalmış biri olarak, Avrupa standartlarında Türkiye'de bulunan tek kamping diyebilirim. Temizlik, sakinlik, huzur arıyorsanız burası tam size göre ama mangalımı yakarım, müziğimi açarım, rakımı içerim, sarhoş olunca da bağırırım diyorsanız yan tarafta ki kamping size daha uygun demektir. Deniz konusuna gelirsek, deniz pis değil ancak ince yosunlar var. Bunlardan iğreniyorsanız plastik bir deniz ayakkabısı ile bu sorunu çözebilirsiniz. Yukarıda yazdığım bakış açısına göre giderseniz kesinlikle Türkiye'de yapacağınız en huzurlu kamping deneyimini yaşayacaksınız.",
      "Bir kamp alanı için çok lüks denebilir. Çadıe alanına araba girmesi yasak. Tuvaletler çok temiz ve kullanabileceğiniz bir duşakabin var, tabii ki 5dakikadan fazla kalmanız yasak. Ortak mutfakta ki dolapları istediğiniz gibi kullanabilir, dolapta ki sizin olmayan bir şeyi bir sonra ki gün yenilemek şartıyla alabilirsiniz. İçerisi yaz ayında bile serin denebilir. Denize 0 mesafede. Kamp alanı ağaçlık sabahları güneşten pişmiyorsunuz. İçerde yüksek sesli müzik ve büyük led ışıklar yasak. Herkese öneririm fiyatlar da gerçekten çok uygun.",
      "2016 Ramazan ayında arkadaş grubumuzla 4 kişi gittik, önce ant kampta yer olmadığı için daha doğrusu sahibi kamp yapanların özel hayatlarına saygı duyduğu ve çadırları fazla sıkıştırmak istemediği için kapıdağ kampingde kaldık, orayı öven arkadaşlar ortak alanların pisliğini ve gece dip dibe olan çadırlardaki gürültüden ve ortalığın pisliğinden hiç bahsetmemiş, Ant camping kesinlikle muhteşem bir kamp alanı, ilk kampımızı yaptığımız yer ve gittiğimiz her yerde aynı özveriyi ve temizliği bekliyoruz haliyle ve böyle bir yeri bulmak zor.Gece yıldızları izlemek için ışık kirliliğine bile izin vermeyen her daim çalışan bir yönetici var orada. Başta bizi kabul etmediği için ben de sinir olmuştum ama prensip sahibi olduğu için kimse suçlayamaz.İlk fırsatta yine gideceğiz, Ahmet Abi selamlar.",
      "Burayi tavsiye üzerine tercih ederek gittik. Başlangıçta muhtemelen giremeyecegimizi düşündük ancak buraya girebilmemizin zorlugunu girdikten sonra anladım. Anlatılmaz yaşanır bir kamp yeridir. Bu duzeni saglamak cok zor birsey. Tamam denizi ile ilgili çok söylenen şeyler var haklidirlar kendilerine göre  ama deniz bence cennet gibi bir yer yengeç deniz kestanesi bilimum canlı görebilirsiniz kamp demekte bu değilmi doğal yaşamın içinde bir yer bulabilmek değilmi?  Kamp temizliği ile 5 yıldızlı Oteller ile yarisir. Kıyaslama yapmak gerekirse pis olan en az 30 tane 5 Yıldızlı Otel sayarim. Gidin görün oradan ayrılır iken emin olun uzuleceksiniz. Bende artık Ant camping ailesinden biri olduğum için çok sevincli ve kendimi  çok şanslı hissediyorum. Şiddet ile tavsiye ederim doğayı seviyorsanız burası tam size göre."

Un entorno maravilloso, puedes ir con niños y siempre hay actividades que realizar con ellos, aceptan mascotas, la zona del camping con mucha sombra y muy cuidado y la atención de Jose Luis y de Nico es lo mejor.

Las excursiones en kayak genial. El restaurante debe mejorar ya que parece que la cocinera/o es novata/o o está de práctica (pedimos una paella q  y estaba  sin sal y sin sabor alguno) por un menú de 13 euros en la zona debe servir mejor comida para poder competir. Eso sí buen trato por parte del personal",

Gode faciliteter til både madlavning, opvask, bade og toiletter. Venligt og imødekommende personale. Hyggelig stemning og en afslappet atmosfære. Kan varmt anbefale stedet.

Los cubos de basura no tienen tapa por lo que en verano el olor y las moscas son bastante desagradables. Los perros andan sueltos por el camping por lo que proliferan las defecaciones de los mismos y asustan a los niños cuando salen tranquilamente a los caminos . Y aunque la responsabilidad de los excrementos de los perros es también de los dueños el máximo responsable es el camping ya que  los perros deben estar atados y la dirección debe obligar a los dueños a cumplir esta ley.  La megafonía no funciona con lo cual es imposible dar avisos. En fín un camping a la que la segunda categoría se la han regalado.",

Nelle aree comuni sono disponibili delle cucine per i campeggiatori con forni e frigoriferi. I bagni sono nuovi e pulitissimi e non hanno nulla da invidiare a quelli degli hotel. Il campeggio ha la spiaggia ed accesso diretto al mare. Rapporto qualità prezzo altissimo. Imperdibile"

And if you want a warm shower it will cost you 5 kr. ",

Best part of the experience was the croissants (best I've ever tasted) but you could probably order them from another camping in the area.\n\nStaff hardly gave any info and seemed rushed, sanitary facilities had a semi-finished roof and some guys smoking weed, walking distance to the swimming pool / reception was 5-10 min and there was a constant stream of wasps visiting our camping spot which didn't enhance the experience.

Leuke kinderspeelplaats, een niet zo groot maar verwarmd zwembad. Honden meer dan welkom (nee, niet in het bad).\n\n's Morgens tegen negen uur bakker op camping, in stadje op 6 km voldoende andere voorzieningen (supermarkten, banken, tabac, presse, apotheek etcetera). Voor vermaak en water ligt op 20 km het enorme Lac de Der, met veel toeristische attracties.\n\nAbsoluut hoogtepunt van de camping: het vrolijke, gastvrije en zeer behulpzame beheerders-echtpaar. Zij spreekt ook Engels, maar hij zwaait het vrolijkst naar alle gasten. We zouden twee nachten blijven, het werden vier weken.

A large campsite, where the rules of plots did not apply, you pitched your tent where ever there was a sensible space, and close to the nearest electric hook up, of which there were plenty dotted around the site. The welcome was friendly, while we were checking in the young lady asked if we would like some patries fetching for the morning, which we took advantage of. The amenties were plentiful and very clean, there is a swimming pool by the reception but we didn't use it. Reasonable pricing too, will certainly consider staying here again if we are ever in the area.",

Almost every place were occupated and the only one that was to far from toilets had a noisy pools behind railing at neighborhood. As the last point in our dislike list was a beach quality. Yellow coarse river sand and deep waters with huge waves, not for children under 16. So we decided to move forward to the next camping even we were so tired and it was dinner time.",

Fra pladsen er der fine stier til både Simrishamn og til de flotte klipper tæt pp pladsen hvor man kan slappe af.

Rätt äckligt att låta hunden pissa och skita precis utanför där man sitter..och jävligt dålig stil av vuxna att bara låta det ske. Hur fan tänker folk? Men dom är duktiga på att ta upp efter hunden så där ligger inget kvar.\nNere vid grusplanen/parkeringen finns ju ett skogsparti där hunden kan göra vad den vill. Gå ner dit.\nKanske något campingvärden kunde ändra på tills vi kommer 2018."

      "Not a great campsite at all. The toilets and shower area absolutely stunk. \nSeriously, I have visited a lot of campsites in my lifetime and this ranks very poorly. Not sure what the problem with sewerage disposal was but it was a terrible smell, and totally put off the person with me from camping. It was her first experience of a campsite and it was so terrible for her she vowed never to do it again. The smell was so bad I even said aloud to someone \"hold your breath before going in there\". I didnt even have a shower that day it was so bad. On the positive side there are some nice walks around there and its off a good highway. situated just right for a stopover. would not go there again",

      "Een goede doortrekkers camping dicht bij de snelweg. Kosten 17 euro per plek met elektra. Er is geen water op de plek aanwezig. Alleen bij het sanitair.\n\nAls je van dieren houdt zit je zeker goed. Honden van de eigenaar lopen los over de camping heen. Ook de kippen lopen soms langs je plek. Rare is dat er een kraai rond de camping blijft die van alles probeert te eten. Hij heeft al verschillende keren scheerlijnen of knoopjes van de tent proberen te halen.\n\nZit een eet tentje bij waar je voor 8 euro een hamburger of broodje kabab met een grote berg patat. Brood moet je bij de receptie dag van te voren reserveren.\n\nSanitair gebouw is netjes. Geen wc papier aanwezig en douches zijn niet temperatuur instelbaar. Helaas zijn er geen goede afwas baken bij het gebouw dus moet met gieter of afwasbak vol terug naar je plek.\n\nNiet bijzondere camping. Het is wel heerlijk rustig in de omgeving. Prima camping voor een nacht"

      "Wonderful place. The staff are great and the pitches are nice. The pool was good, but unfortunately it was very slippery. My mother fell and had a deep cut. The kids club had lots going on from crafts to capture the flag. The restaurant looked good. There were lots of parks, a fishing lake and a good shop. The shower blocks were good, but again the floor was slippery and some of the showers were tiny. Overall this is a lovely campsite in a great location. ",
      "\nA great place very attractive setting.\nSome pitches are dufficult to get on.\nThe access gate is difficult for long caravans.\nPool is nice..in August its one long kid screaming session..like all french sites with pools\nLots of caravan clubbers.....\nAs seems common the electricity supply i had was reverse polarity..that matters and can be dangerous.\nDont these electrical installers have polarity testers.\nYou need a map to find the dog walk.\nThe restaurant etc fulfill the needs.\nIt would be nice in the spring or autumn",
      "Very nice and quiet (Apart from busy times in the evening).\nThere is a kids club to keep your little ones entertained for a few hours (not used, we have no money leeches)\nNice and clean indoor pool with a dedicated sun lounger area so you can work on your tan and dip in the pool.\n\nLovely countryside feel with birds singing in the trees and gentle sounds of running water. \n\nSite is clean and very well maintained,deserving of its high ratings. \n\nPitches are a good size but I suggest checking the pitch you are given before setting up to ensure you have the space you are after. \n\nA premium pitch service is on offer here where an additional fee can be paid per night for such items as a fridge,sun loungers and patio furniture, great if you are travelling light or enjoy lots of cheese!\n\nYou can also pre order baked items such as breads and pastries.\n\nThe site is about 10km from Jonville which offers a Super U and an Intermarche,so plenty of shopping places for food and drink. \n\nI would definitely return, only the changeable weather put a small damper on our holiday but you can't review that! \n\n ",

      "Our stay at Wadi Rum Green Desert Camp was memorable for many reasons. Reaching this place is easy as we were picked up at the Wadi Rum entrance. Breathtaking environment, comfortable tents and great hospitality from the camp owner Nadjah. He provided good company, information and insight on Bedouin life in the wadi. The food was so delicious that we looked forward to every meal. All the best 👍🏼",
      "From start to end, Nadjah was excellent and extremely accommodating bedouin host. He speaks very good English and is kind, friendly and genuine. Nadjah owns and operates his small and personal camp, he takes extra special pride with every detail, which is visible. The camp is first rate, with bed and covers provided, extra blankets are provided in cold weather. It is in excellent location away form other Camps. The bathrooms are clean and had running water (bring your own shower gel and towel). Food was delicious and plentiful. Sitting around the fire at night is enjoyable, talking with other guests, listening to music if there are more guess. Solar power provided the electricity for lights and charging stations; the camp is neat and tidy, leaving a very small footprint. I did Jeep tour, scramble to Burdah, hike to Umm Ad Dami and Camel riding. I could spend there days. Desert is huge and provides spectacular views, colour changing sand and different rock formations, so peaceful. Nadjah can make any additional arrangements if required, such as transfers, hot air balloon ride or climbing. I couldn't have been happier, I highly recommend Nadjah and his camp to anyone looking for a magical experience. I have been to different Camps but nothing can compare to WDGD, would go back again, anytime. It is safe for individuals, family friendly and even dogs are allowed. I loved everything about our trip to Wadi Rum; truly a very special place. Thanks a million Nadjah! Please keep doing wonderful work :-)",

      "We have just left Rumshines Camp after spending 2day-1night. The minute you arrive to Wadi rum desert you feel you are stepping into another world .we went an exciting 4x4 jeep ride through the dessert ,and we ride the Camel. The staff are excellent. I would recommend staying there. The food was good. We felt we had the place   \nto ourselves. Definitely worth staying",
      "I love that the camp's location has that rocky wall behind it which makes for the perfect spot to watch the sun set. The camp itself was comfortable and clean, the blankets sufficiently kept us warm especially during the wind-howling early morning, the food was genuinely good, and the whole amazing experience is capped off by the warm company of Khaled and Yousef. I especially enjoyed the lunch picnic made by Yousef by the side of a mountain after our desert walk of about 2 kilometers. And the stories shared by Khaled after dinner while we sip the delicious Bedouin tea! Their excellent service extends beyond the camp too. Khaled was kind enough to help us arrange a taxi that will take us to Petra, and gave us tips to make sure we don't get overcharged by taxi drivers for our succeeding trips. I will definitely recommend Rumshines to anyone who wants to have a great Wadi Rum experience!",
      "All you expect of a desert camp, which is not much. The tent is small but satisfying, there are running water in the shower and the toilet were clean. The meal was a bit smaller than we wished, not filling for a man with appetite.",
      "Most of the “camps” in Wadi Rum listed on the Internet (TripAdvisor, Routard, etc.) don’t actually exist. Their “owners” together with the help of their girlfriends, who write and speak good English, create a fake website and post a lot of self-promoting reviews in order to attract naive tourists. As a result, travellers find themselves in trouble and get scammed.\n\nThat is why, before going to Wadi Rum, insist the desert camps on sending you a scanned copy of their license, as 99.9% of them don’t have one.\n\nHave this in mind before booking any tour, and don’t let Bedouins fool you with fake reviews and nemorous self-compliments."

      "We visited the camp in February 2016 for one night and a day tour. We met some of the most friendly people here. Even though it was off season for tourists, they've organized everything for only the two of us. We were basically alone in the camp. The owner is really friendly, helpful and flexible.\nOne of the best experiences I had so far. Highly recommend this camp.",
      "Mehedi tailored me a three day trip that had all I wanted: a camel trek, doing the Burdah arch and bivouacking out in the desert.\nIbrahim, my camel guide, did a great job to teach me the fundamentals of how to get a camel to do what I wanted - with some success! He is a knowledgeable, personable and interesting chap who made the 4 hour trip from the village to the camp a very interesting time.\nThe camp is in a hidden, secluded opening in a narrow canyon and has been built to resemble a Bedouin settlement. You'll sleep in simple, but very comfortable little 'tent' compartments with plenty of warm cover for the cold nights. Food is taken in the communal dining tent - and is tasty, plentiful and in the Bedouin tradition. I slept like a log in total comfort.\nSalah took me up to the Burdah Arch next morning - nice scrambling, breath-taking scenery and mind-blowing views at the top. After a leisurely lunch (and lots of the additive Bedouin tea!) up on the mountain he put me on a foot march through the desert and after meeting at Lawrence's house found a deserted and secluded place for the bivouac. The Bedouin stew he cooked on an open fire was tasty - and how he baked bread over an open fire and using the hot embers to get both sides crunchy was quite amazing. In Bedouin style the bread then gets broken up and mixed with the stew, so that you can roll it and eat it by hand - which took a bit of practice! \nSleeping out in the open under the stars was something I had wanted to do for a while - and it was just as phenomenal and liberating as I always thought it would be. \nSalah's expert guiding and his easy manner made him a great companion.\nAll in all, what I really liked about Mehdi's operation was the genuine, no false frills approach to making you have a great time among what felt like new friends. I couldn't recommend him more to anybody who is after a great experience, expertly delivered.",
      "I visited Bedouin Directions in November 2013 and stayed 3 nights at the camp with my best pal, both of us seeking a quiet beautiful place, in undeveloped pristine desert for us to explore and enjoy while catching up. We couldn't have been more thrilled with this place. The guys at the camp were Bedouin who clearly loved and knew their beautiful desert. We walked out of the camp each day for an un-guided walk about and saw some of the most incredible desert-scapes we've ever seen. By night we enjoyed the provided cooked meal as well as a communal experience with the guys playing music (singing, clapping & oud) as well as fun Bedouin games with them and the other guests. The whole experience is one i will remember dearly forever. I highly recommend Bedouin Directions for those interested in having a unique cultural experience while making accessible incredible desert wilderness.",

Terrible neighbours with little interest in others...party of maybe 30-40...noisy, plenty of music well into the night. We're leaving early....not so family friendly (but maybe just take the kids past the neighbours at 5am).",

Great amenities (amazing showers!!) and very happily situated on the river. Will definitely stay here with the family one day, within short driving distance to all of the beautiful areas of the bay and outside of the hustle and bustle....",

      "Great place. \n\nBig hike to the car and campground especially for people that have lots of equipment and children. It's about a 250 metre walk. There is a boom gate (normally locked) at the base of the car park which leads to the campground via a service road. The road itself is also downhill to the camp ground and a tad uneven. I highly suggest a box trolley if you have one. That'll make others jealous and save you a few trips!!\n\nThe scenery on the other hand is absolutely incredible ! At sunset or sunrise you can get some magnificent postcard shots!! \n\nLots of wildlife in the camping ground. \n\nFacilities are 5/10.",
      "Where do I start? This is an amazing camping ground, I highly recommend it. The amenities are basic: toilets, bins, some free firewood, two electric BBQ but no showers. If you want some showers you will need to go to the Green Patch camping ground next door. But you do not go there for the amenities, you go there for the wildlife and the beach. You will wake up surrounded by kookaburras and kangaroos. The beach is beautiful, the sand is pure white and it is a great alternative to Hyam's beach. Two important things to keep in mind: you need to book your spot in advance on their website and you cannot park your car near your tent, you will have to carry everything over 300m. Make sure you get there a few hours before sunset then. And before I forget, this is a great place for photography and shoot the milky way :)",
      "Good camp ground with plenty of open space. Beach is really close and has some of the finest views in Jervis Bay (highly recommend going at night). The only issue would be the walk from the parking lot to the camp site, so pack light! ",
      "Can't complain it's beautiful. The waves were great every day for learner surfing. Wild life stunning. Cold showers and toilets. But fire places aplenty",
      "Free firewood, great views, close to beach and friendly wildlife. Apparently there are red belly black snakes but I didn't come across any in the winter. Bit of an uphill walk back to the carpark and a lot of tourists come through which can get annoying if you're camping."

      "What an incredible hidden gem! I biked in on my cycle tour of Southern Australia, not sure what to expect. It was worth the extra few kilometers to get to. Gloriously HOT showers, firewood for purchase on site, beautiful vistas, and only a short walk to the most gorgeous beach. Staff were very friendly and helpful. With it being mid-week in the winter, there was only one other site occupied, and it was very quiet. ",
      "$28 for two adults, then another $10 for firewood. We set up our pitch, perfectly adequate in its size. It had a metal wood fire BBQs on each site, we had a lovely cackling fire, and put our cast iron plate on top and cooked our snags over it. The beach is really close by, very beautiful place to walk and wonder around the rock pools. Showers are lovely and hot, well pressured. Camp kitchen facilities are good too. All in all a lovely place to camp. ",
      "We have come here for 2 years for the school's father son camp. The camp has great facilities with a well maintained bathroom. There was no need to even take toilet paper, although the soap did run out. The beach is a small walk away and the campsite even has fireplaces. Cant go wrong",
      "After paying just under $100 for one night for an unpowered site, we (2 adults & 1 child) were disappointed to discover the site allocated to us was barely large enough to fit a car, tent and swag. Half the site was completely unusable due to it being inclined. We moved to an \"overflow\" area where the only decent shaded spot was near a group of campers who were loud well into the night.\nThe facilities were in poor condition considering what we payed for the site, and the toilets were not properly cleaned.",

      "Booderee National Park is a hidden gem of NSW. Just around 2.5 to 3 hours from Sydney and you are in this beautiful part of the world, which is so well preserved. Once you are inside Booderee National Park, plan for a full day of activities. You have a beach with unbelievable white sand and the whole horizon looking at you. The beaches are not crowded like the city beaches. There is a shower facility as well near the beach area and some picnic tables as well. There is plenty of leveled grass area to enjoy and relax.\n\nI doubt if you will be able to cover all the lookouts and spots in this National Park in one day. The entry ticket enables you to visit on 2 continuous days. The headlands provide mind blowing 180 views and keep your camera ready to catch the views and also passing ships.",

Unfortunately it's also quite developed with extensive paved paths, toilet blocks and large campgrounds on the slopes above the beach. In summer it's extremely busy, but visit during the shoulder months and you can often have the place to yourself. It's an incredible location, so beautiful and perfect for kids to play in the calm waters of the little beach-back creek or the bay itself.",

The cabin was completely decked out including spa bath, gas fireplace, electric blankets and all appliances and equipment you would need to stay indefinitely. There were two outdoor areas, one out back with a view of the ocean and one out front with bbq and sink. We loved our stay in our little beach cabin and we are sad to have to leave.",

      "The best park I have ever stayed at, and I have stayed at a few. Has everything you need and want, kids paradise and adults too. Direct access to a beautiful beach, swimming pool and kids water park plus jumping pillow. Accommodation was spot on, 3 bedrooms 2 bathrooms couldn't get better. We had an issue with the shower sorted and reimbursed for our trouble. Definitely will be back.",
      "Great location by the beach. Facilities are good, clean and adequate. No kettles in the kitchen though. Plenty of playing facilities to keep the little ones busy. Their favourite was the jumping pillow.",
      "We always stay at Easts Beach KIAMA as it's always amazing.  Everything about it is great for families.  This time we had our relatives from BELGIUM staying with us.  They thoroughly enjoyed themselves and were particularly happy with the view, the loft itself and the beautiful location.  Oh and the weather.  Thank you to the office staff, the cleaners, the grounds staff and maintenance crew, you're all AWESOME!",
      "Lovely park in a great location. Loads for the kids to do - waterpark, pool, jumping pillow, bike-riding, beach, climbing on rocks, games room, soft play area, walking to the Little Blow Hole... We didn't actually leave for two days as we didn't need too. Lovely sheltered beach right in front. Ocean View Villas are perfected located across from the beach.",
      "We stayed here a few weeks into a long trip up the east coast with our two young children. We invested a little more in the beach front cabin and it was worth every cent! Such a beautiful spot and to stay with the water basically at the door was a treat. The kids loved running over to the sand and we loved that we could camp out with a coffee on the deck and watch them. We foraged the sand most days and found shark egg cases and shells the kids had never seen before. The water park wasn't finished yet but we didn't notice as the beach had us captivated. The water park will be a fantastic addition to some already impressive facilities. The cabins themselves were very luxurious. It was nice not to sleep on a 'slab of concrete' for a few nights. Service was great from the staff too. All over it is a must visit! "

The place has the best chilling zone and the best spot to catch the sunrise as all the hot air balloons taking off. Would definitely recommend this place for those who are looking for a campsite with fair price and goos facilities ",
      "We fell in love with this place! Ahmet, the owner, did not only provide us with a tent when we didn't have one but also helped us by giving recommendations for the best trails and sunset views. The campsite, including kitchen and washrooms, is neat and clean and the chill out area is a comfortable place with love for the detail. Only a fridge to store food would be nice, but I guess not obligatory for a campsite.",

      "This place is probably the best camp ground on the ring road. 1700isk per person per night, showers included, a proper outdoors sitting area with cooking stoves, gas, bench and tables, helpful reception who let you borrow utensils and pots, great experience with people camping here, we had a blast with some folks one night! Firepit also available outside.",
      "We stayed at this site in mid-October. The price was 1700 isk per person, which was little higher than elsewhere in Iceland. Included was unlimited hot showers, which were quite clean and access to the brand new toilet block. There was also a large shed with gas stoves, kettle and dining tables. The shed was not heated, but was fully enclosed. However, the day we left the shed was actually dismantled. Not sure why this was the case - surely it would be most needed in winter? The cooking stoves were moved outside for some reason. Maybe they are building a proper communal cooking area? Time will tell. The campsite was perfectly situated to explore the various sites around the lake which was truly beautiful. Wifi was available in the reception, although I believe you had to pay extra to use it, similarly you had to pay 100 isk extra to use the socket to charge items (or be sneaky and unplug the kettle!).",
      "Nice location to explore Myvatn area with great view of lake Myvatn in the morning. Camp site is well sheltered from the wind, kitchen is indoor, very warm and clean toilet, free clothing drying available at reception. It gets very dark in camp area away from reception and kitchen, we saw aurora and lots of stars.",
      "... excellent facilities, chemical toilet dumping site for motorhomes, communal shower with hair dryers for males but none for females at the time, long hose for motorhome water top up. met our needs during our ring road trip.",
      "Reasonable price (1700 per adult) due to location. Shower in the price. Small kitchen with dinning area, in a tent (not heated, without wather, not equiped). Most crowded one we stayed on Iceland (shoulder season). But well divided with nice views."

      "The best family friendly campground we experienced in Iceland.  There are several small shallow ponds with fun features for children. This campground and the surrounding forested area had dozens of cute domestic rabbits roaming free. There are also many ducks that come running when food may be made available to them.  Our son had so much fun hand feeding them bran flake cereal. Bathrooms were tidy with 5  toilet stalls and 2 showers.  Outdoor area for cleaning cookware. The main building with community kitchen is a bit of a walk from the  camp area.  The minigolf was not open during our stay.  ",
      "This was one of our favourite campsites in Iceland, and we stayed more nights then we originally planned to.  The staff were friendly and helpful, and even went above and beyond to help us when our camper van got stuck in some soft gravel close to the campsite (bad place to park to take pictures of ponies!) The bathrooms were warm and relatively spacious, and the showers are free, and there is good space to wash up.  The ground was a bit soggy in October and the only real negative point was that the kitchen is very small and badly laid out for communal use. But there are walks nearby, a play area and washer/dryer facilities, a great place for families I would say.",
      "1400 ISK per person (in tent). Nice bathroom included in price. Not many benches outside but we were there in the end of September so they’re probably preparing for end of the season.",
      "Very nice facilities at good price (shower included in the entrance). Has a kitchen and a place to eat in a building near the reception. Fantastic views! ",

      "A very warm place where you can enjoy the nature while have a lot of fun with your friends. Don't forget although that this is a camping not a five start hotel so you will share the shower cabin with the other members from the camping. The same thing with the kitchen. The camping has a large kitchen where you can find lots of dishes and useful tools that you can use to prepare your food. The living room its the star of this place, its a large-rustic room, we were 28 people there and had no problems with the space. \nThe camping also has a large green space where you can play and exercise, 2 barbecues and large outside spaces where you can take your meals.",

Unfortunately they think it's a good idea to let the gardner cut the grass at 9 PM and that is something they can control!",

Some of the waiters are not to motivated and sometimes the food was bland. But overall an ok experience."

      "I love this camp! I'll start from the top: first of all the owners are kind-hearted, helpful and you feel like at home. They are wonderful! Next the campsite has toilets and really good showers and it's clean! And I've been to 10 other camps in Romania, half of them more expensive than this one and I was grieving to use the toilets. Furthermore it's quite cheap: 2 adults and a ten is 40 lei (10€), with camper it's 50 lei (=12€). When it comes to the ground it's very easy to set up your tent - the ground is not hard. There's also a kitchen which has a kettle, coffee maker, microwave, stove and a fridge. In the morning you wake up being surrounded by mountains and you can hear the stream. I really recommend this place. I know that even if this camp will not be on my route I'm still gonna go even 4 additional hours if I'm somewhere in the \"neighbourhood\" just to spend some time there. ",
      "This camping has a good location. You can hear nearby stream/river. Clean restrooms. Hosts are open and talkative. After beeing on 10 other camps in Romania this was the best one.",

      "Beware do not subject your property to the possible damage this place can cause! I am not sure if the other people who have given this park know anymore about electrical requirements for RV's than the owners do! I called and asked for a 50 amp spot and they said sure come on we have you covered! Upon arrival I find the 50 amp plug is being fed by a 3 conductor 30 amp SO cord that clearly states 30 amp RV use only! Upon further inspection I find that the feed to the 50 amp breaker are #12 wire which is rated for no more than 20 amps. So I contacted the owners and the husband was a real DB about the whole thing.. When I told him about what he had going on his response was and I quote \"are you afraid your gonna burn your little trailer down?\" I you value your rig and don't know much about electrical requirements do not stay here. You will have damaged components that may not show up until 2 parks later!",
      "I am updating my review of this RV park. I travel for a living and basically live in RV parks. I wouldn't say I am an expert, but I would say I know how to rate one. This park is very well kept. The Wifi works well (unless you are in peak use time and that cant be helped). The owners are very helpful people and have always done everything they could to make me feel at home. The monthly price is very reasonable, and you aren't billed for water or electricity. And a really nice touch is that they can now sell propane on site!",

The public restrooms are all tiled from floor to ceiling with TV's in them! Great place and I would recommend to anyone...",

We stayed in lot #69 which was very tight and our fire pit was right next to another camper. All lots looked fairly small as well but overall it was a great experience and we'd return. ",

Couldn't ask for more except some tree work to make access in and out easier for a big rig - we're a 40ft 5th wheel and struggled out  between the trees and telegraph pole with full sites each side"

Plan on returning, can't say enough good about the place.",
      "Horrible. I wouldn't give any stars. Do not waste your money. Selected this place because it was close to the Ohio Caverns and the canoe livery we were visiting. Upon arriving we were told the pool was done. The site said there was a playground and activities. The playground consisted of 2 swings a slide and funnel ball. They had a pavillion where it looked like thy held activities but there were none. The owners also advertise a pond for fishing with boats. The pond is roped off and there are no boats. The last straw was when we were coming back from our last outing and the owner said, \"I didn't think you were coming back. We just bleached the well. You can't use the water for cooking or washing\". So apparently we paid for 3 nights and were just going to abandon our camper in this woman's eyes by her saying she didn't expect us back. DO NOT STAY HERE!",
      "Great little private campground! Owners are super friendly and beyond helpful. The seasonal campers were very friendly too. The bathrooms and showers were small but that is to be expected of an older campground. They were well stocked and super clean. The trees were huge and provided lots of shade. We didn't swim but the pool looked very clean. We were there for Labor Day weekend and they had several things going on including a kids fishing tournament, a movie for the kids, corn hole tournament, and a DJ. The whole campground is very well maintained. Wonderful experience and we will definitely be back!",
      "Yes,  family oriented. If you are related or friends they treat you well. Otherwise they will treat you like crap and try to gig you for everything. Watched them talking crap about a perm camper at bottom of hill.  My family will never spend another weekend there!! ",

They have a park with various playground equipment including a smaller slide for the younger kids and a larger one for the bigger kids. There is a beach to play on and a designated swimming area with a dock to jump in the water. Other thing to enjoy include fishing, basketball, shuffle board, volley ball, and tether ball.They also have special activities on holiday weekends and an open air dance once a year. The rest of the experience is up to you (cards, campfires, walking around the lakes, family, and bring your friends or making new ones)!",
